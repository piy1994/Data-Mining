246	1	We are non locals; came here for Happy hour and we stuffed our faces for $36 total. Totally worth it.  Food:  Pork belly- flavorless Bulgogi-good Spicy Pork-awesome Complimentary side dishes lacked freshness. Environment: Clean and modern Service: Dave was an awesome server! We kept ordering more and he was friendly and patient with us.
1131	1	This place rocks. Break out of your Pad Thai rut and order Northern specialties like the Kao Tod appetizer - spicy sour sausage salad, and the whole catfish, charcoal grilled. Ask for the two sauces, chili-lime and tamarind. Order a glass of Riesling from their extensive collection. You'll be glad you did.
121	1	A perfect bite after a night of drinking and dancing, enough to soak up the alcohol and slap you back to sobriety.   My BFF and I decided to play a round of pool after the club and after hustling it from several unsuspecting men, treated ourselves to pizza. From what I can remember at 4am, the place wasn't marked with obvious signs of house made pizzas. But what was vivid was kicking off our heels, putting our feet up and enjoying my glorious cheese pizza- with extra money in our purses.
118	0	This has to rate as bad as the Stratosphere buffet, only worse because at least at Stratosphere someone will get you a soda, a refill, and clean up the area around your table.   I was so hungry and didn't feel like walking back to Mirage or Treasure Island, both of which have great food, excellent service, and reasonable prices. So in  a rush to get some food I settled for Flavors. Wow! What a mistake.   Upon walking up to the cashier to pay for my meal, all three cashier continued their conversation, looking at me, saying nothing to me, and talking for over 2 minutes. Finally I said "can I pay here to eat in this buffet" and they looked at me liked I had stolen their kid. Isn't the cashier at the buffet suppose to take your money. And from here it only gets worse.  The hostess seats me at table next to a 80 year old man that has no respect for the space around him, or himself. The piled plates, the newspapers scattered around his table, and the booth on both side of him covered in his thrown about newspapers. The hostess tells me to sit and leaves all the newspaper on my seat. I looked at her like she was crazy and she pushed the papers slightly for my butt to have a clear space.   From here... oh god, the food is disgusting. Fat and grizzle in the roast beef so bad you can't chew it. Old crusted over foods, and empty containers of food everywhere.   After I sit down and eat my food I finish my soda, I say to the waitress can you please get me a diet coke and water. She snaps back..."this isn't my section, I am off." Now she is clearing tables, and is dressed like all the other servers, and she is the only one in my area. So I say.."can you please find the person who is working I would like a diet coke and water." She says, "let me see what I can do."  A trip to get a wilted salad and over 10 minutes later I still have no soda. So I ask to see the manager. This buffet was $28. I have no problem with paying $28 to get a decent meal and decent service. Flavors is far from decent anything. Stay away it's a dump.
319	1	Great atmosphere, customer service, very good food for the money. Delicious burgers, not the greasy type from the fast food restaurants that give you a heartburn, but a very delicate, tasty, creative ones that leave you feeling full, yet not overloaded. Great beer selection as well.
1020	1	When we first walked in it was a bit overwhelmingly with the noise and it's a wide open space.  They seated us very quickly and got to omit drinks right away.  One server Erin came to our table slowly there after to take our order and answer any questions we had.  My wife doesn't eat regular sausage and we were very impressed with the vast ability to substitute. We were here for breakfast, but i peeked at the lunch menu and you can build your own burger with ground beef, chicken breast, turkey, or a vegetable patty.  I had the fiesta green chili skillet and it was amazing.  Perfectly spiced and filling.   My wife had a burrito and substituted turkey sausage and fruit.  We each got one of the banana bread muffins which I highly recommend. Erin was our server and she was very attentive and pleasant.  This was a nice way to start the day.  I highly recommend making this past of your Vegas stay.
1319	0	Terrible food! At a $21.99 price point I expected much more choices. There was lackluster breakfast options and even more lackluster lunch options. All the food had 0 seasoning. I will never return to this buffet, if there was an option to give 0 stars without a doubt. My group will need to go get food after eating this overly priced buffet .
1297	0	Just like so many first timers, I was extremely excited to try this place. I just wanted to go. So many great words were expressed about this place that I found myself craving to try this experience out. my GLUTEN FREE AND VEGAN folks, stay away if you're going for dessert. I was really hoping that I would be able to find at the very least two or three different options what I found was a scoop of sorbet was my only option. Even though I was kind of heart broken that I couldn't fully experience this cute little place, I went ahead and ordered my sorbet ... Well, my waitress forgot to bring it out. She brought out everyones food ( which I couldn't order anything) and then when she brought out dessert mine was missing. By the time she came back my friends were done with their meals and desserts that I had to tell her to forget about it. The place is really cute, the view of the strip is nice ( outside patio) but the service wasn't great and their aren't really options for us Gluten free and Vegan people. Want to go for the decor? I say go! cute little spot and it is an experience, but prepared to make your tummy grumble and growl if you are a Gluten and Dairy Free person.
395	0	My husband and I live in Las Vegas. We thought that it would be a fun experience. We never had the chance to find out, but reading the other reviews I glad we did not. The hostess needs to find another job. It was as if we were a bother to her. She was extremely rude. We were  dumped by the bar and told we could get food from the bar. We received no menus. I have always thought of living here as a privilege. We have access to great food at any restaurant here in Vegas. My recommendation is go anywhere else except Seor Frog. Do yourself a favor. They get zero stars!
1958	1	Yep! The expected stellar dining experience only Gordon Ramsay can guarantee!!  For Appetizer, we ordered the "Fuzzy Chicken Wings." Spicy & Tangy w/blue cheese crumbs! They were DAZZLING! Fell off the bone! Hmph!  For the Entree we ordered the "Uber Cheese Burger," -fontina, raclette & goat cheese- I added a fried egg! O. M. G! Superb cooking technique of the meat! It's the first thing you will notice! Very Woodsy! We also ordered the American. Boring, uninspired selection I thought...NOT SO! In fact, after BOTH of those selections I can confirm I will never enjoy any other Burger again after this experience, and if I NEVER eat a burger except here, I'm A okay with that! Oh! Can't forget the Truffle Fries! My God, if you are an Atheist, you won't be after the Truffle Fries! In fact, this has to qualify as baptism! The friggin Truffle Fries are a Divine Spiritual Experience!  Enjoy!!
731	0	So I was in Vegas over the weekend and I have finally recovered! What a fun weekend! Of course with all Vegas weekends there is always some type of drama and unfortunately it was hotel drama. There was 3 of us checking in and our check in went smoothly, the room was nice but upon checking in we got in our room to find our toilet was not working. We called down to have it looked at, they sent engineering up to our room and the toilet was fixed. Fast forward a few hours and I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and it was broken AGAIN...I really had to go and went down stairs to the lobby to use the restroom. I went back up after I was done, my key had been demagnetized so I had to go to the front desk to get a new key and I mentioned to the front desk person what was happening with the toilet and he was very receptive to my issue. He said we could move rooms in the morning (it was 4am) AWESOME. I went back up to the room and went back to bed. In the morning I mentioned to the girls what happened and called down to move rooms. You would think I dreamt the whole conversation with the front desk guy no one had record of the conversation, the issue or even the engineer visit upon our arrival!!. We had such an issue trying to get a new room, they finally did it but after we went downstairs to speak with guest services and a conversation with the manager. He was a smug individual and I am so surprised that this man is even in the hospitality field. He was condescending and rude and made us feel like whiny bitches. We changed rooms, bathroom worked YES!!! AC did not work well but at this point a working toilet was all I needed and as long as the room was at a comfortable temp I guess it would be fine. The one star is for the shower heads, AWESOME shower heads, water pressure and loved it so much I was taking 2 showers a day. The location is a block off the strip BUT there are a lot of questionable characters in this area, homeless people. They have a little drinking area right next to the hotel in an open lot. We were fine walking in the daytime to the strip but at night a cab was necessary. Looked a little shady. I missed the excitement of a cool Vegas hotel, I will definitely be hitting up a hotel on the strip and never stay at this hotel again.
1691	0	Vegas, in many, many ways, has it all wrong. Their motto should not be that it's some sort of city-wide ziplock sealing so tightly that not even vapors can escape, the metaphorically alluded-to "municipality as black hole". No. Their motto should be one more truthful and perhaps more pithy. That new motto of which I speak would go something like this: Nothing exceeds like excess.  And perhaps no place encapsulates that better than this place. Want to know what's in the dessert case? Well you can just walk (or waddle) yourself over there and go look. The dessert menu has five things on it (order any of these and they're huge). The dessert case has probably 5X that, but damn if they will tell you what that is. The menu itself has a number of things on it. Order any of them but appetizers and they come on a cookie sheet. This not only does wonders for the carefully crafted ambiance, but adds a flair of mystery to things. For instance, I can't begin to imagine the food waste this place must go through, but I'm betting they toss a lot more than anyone ever eats.   Actually, given the flavor, this is almost a guarantee. I can almost hear you smacking your lips right now? You mean to say we can get a bunch of substandard - and here, this word is best - "grub", served by some very smarmy prick who looks vaguely like Fred Arminsen, but is far from funny or even amusing (wait, maybe it is Fred Arminsen!), yet has a full-tilt condescending attitude that all but insists we should be grateful he can be deigned to bother with us mere mortals. Maybe that's it. Maybe the wait staff in this elegantly laid out pristine and serene little oasis from the flood of body odor and stale cigarette smoke isn't here for us, but rather that we're here for them. Now I know why I flew here. I wonder if it would be an insult if I tipped 150%...I'm in but I have to get back out somehow.  Then again, it's a great deal, if you get a lot, right? It may be expensive, but at least it's mediocre! Expensive is the nature of the biz in Vegas and comes with the territory and so, apparently, does throwing any old thing in front of people.  This place clearly doesn't care about patrons coming in and out and is one of the more jaded places I've seen. Maybe they ought to just throw all in and go for "Citizen" by way of the old Soviet Union. I'm thinking a food line with metal bowls and plates. The only thing served will be potato soup with cabbage and garlic, along with a small roll that may or may not be moldy. Drink choices are cheap vodka or brackish water. If nothing else, it would at least accurately mirror the contempt for the customers this place clearly seems to have.  Also, like everything else in Vegas, this place is loud.
214	1	We went here on a Friday morning and we had attentive service. I've also went to egg works, but I actually liked the food better here even though they're all owned by the same people.  I got the stuffed French toast. It's French toast stuffed with eggs, cheese, and your choice of ham, sausage, or bacon. They also have turkey bacon. It also comes with a side of potatoes. I got the homemade orange juice again. It was really delicious but I couldn't eat it all. Afterwards, my waiter said they can do half portions! :)   My other members got burritos and stuffed French toast. They were gobbled up and said they were good.  We also got to claim the free muffin - it was moist and delicious!
317	0	If this is your idea of a ***good*** (not best, because there isn't such a thing as perfect) banh mi, please expose yourself to more locations.  The good things about this place: +Fast +24 hours open (when you're still partying at 4AM and you want something, hell yes) +Bright and clean  +Clean restrooms +Spacious, hip furniture, and no shortage of seats! Lee's designer sure knew his stuff. Visually appealing. +Efficient Service. I like the automatic vietnamese announcer voice that calls your number when you're called to get your sandwich. And then the guy that calls it in english afterward. Cute idea.  The caveats: -The sandwiches (more on that later) -Can't charge card unless $20 has been met (there's a handy ATM machine here though!) -A bit Expensive for Viet sandwiches  The sandwiches here are like fast food to most Viets. Lol it's not the worst, but not the best. It's acceptable. The #11 Special Combo, #1 Lee's Combo, #5 Grilled Pork and #6 BBQ Pork are all okay sandwiches. They all came out THIN, cold, and the quality of the meat is less-than-tasty, like it's been sitting out. At some traditional places, your pickled daikon, carrot slices, and cilantro are placed in a separate baggie for you to put in yourself to your liking. Here, they already place it in for you. Not a huge deal because some banh mi places do this, but it kind of just reminds me of the fast food feel. Veggies weren't exactly fresh.   The bread is a dry french baguette that isn't made fresh daily, but it's okay. The thinness and the scant flavorings of the ingredients is what bothers me. This place is fast food quality. You could make this at home. Not really worth the price. Maybe it's because I'm used to the traditional places or the ones in Cali that do it right with the quality meats and preparation, but it helps to let people know that this is far from a good banh mi spot.     Their ice coffee is awesome though. A bit hard to mess up and loaded with ice, but still tasty. I remember when I was younger and ordered one at Starbucks thinking it'd taste like viet ice coffee...I was definitely disappointed!   I have to say Lee's really knows how to market! I'm pleased that this empire is doing so well. From the first time I experienced in Cali to now (the first one was actually pretty good ages ago), I'm glad that this company is doing awesome. But then again, it's a franchise. Not that that's a bad thing. It's no mom-and-pop contrary to what most people *might* think. But that's like saying that Subway makes the best sandwich you've ever had, in your life, EVER. (I like Subway once in a while...got nothing against them) Or maybe you're happy with that. More power to ya!   What this place does well is introduce people to banh mi. =] It's just okay, not bad or great, but it's fine for a quick bite. The environment is fun to look at and awesome to hang out at with your friends no doubt. And who can argue with that 24-hour opening especially for late night cravings? Does it warrant a 4-star for the taste and ambiance alone? Nope.  As another reviewer asked, would I go to some hole-in-the-wall over this place for a bit better quality tasting sandwich? Yes. Because it's a huge improvement over the banh mi here in taste and quality; costs just as much if not cheaper; and probably all on the same street (not that much farther than here). It's a simple dish, and I'm NOT expecting gourmet but that doesn't mean you should compromise taste for everything else. I recommend people try other banh mi shops for a better one and to keep an open mind!
257	0	MEEEH. I really really really used to love Tao. I went last weekend and my eyes were opened to its overratedness. Don't get me wrong, its a great venue but it definitely has is flaws.   The Venue - Freakin awesome. When all is said and done, you have three levels. On the first level you have the lounge with a ton of couches and a big bar. Not many people dancing though - you also do not need to pay cover to get in here. The next level is the main club level with two separate rooms. One plays hip hop and the smaller plays "Dance". There are bars on every side. Last but not least, Tao Beach is upstairs. Seating, heat lamps, big bar, POOL - its all there. There is also so great decor - YES I DO MEAN BATH TUBS.   So that was the good, onto the bad:   The line. WOW. I get that this is a hot spot in Vegas but the line gets nuts. I have seen it wrap and twist around around the whole outside area. There is an easy fix to this - go have dinner in the amazing restaurant and get a "line pass" stamp at the end of your meal. It will fill you up, save you some time and cut the cost of cover!   The bars - can you say freakin expensive for not the greatest value. Yessir, my Henn was $16. I'm not even a Henn guy and it was still $16. LOL If your a dude, you also have to find a female bartender cause the guys will barely come talk to you if there is any type of crowd around. I almost had to flash a little areola to get a drink.   The space - yes this may be the biggest club I have ever been to but it is too effing packed. Like so packed you can't have fun. It amazes me that there aren't a ton of fights in here. I had no room to dance and less room to even walk. Tao Beach is cool upstairs but its COLD in November.   As nice as the club is, there are too many cons and spots where its easier to have more fun in Vegas.
1014	0	Golden Corral in general is just not what they make it see on tv bottom line. The only thing I liked about this was the service. Im never coming back here. For $18.00 i literally cant believe it. The food quality is cheap and gross. Took not more then 2 bites of my dinner and the proceeded   To the fruits and sweet section. Even my favorite bread pudding i feel like its so good everywhere I go but not here... It was dry and just eh. And dont even get me started on the ratchetry At this location, even though I know its just the location but still.
433	1	My boyfriend and I have been here more than a few times here. We usually come here after work at night time. Always had a good experience and have nothing to complain. The food is always good. We love their Honey Bread the most for the dessert. The bbq grill options has good amount to share as well and very flavorful. The servers are nice as well. We definitely recommend this place.
1655	1	Don't go to In and Out or Fatburger, Come Here!    Hell, you could even have dinner here one night instead of going to a "fancier" establishment.  This will be one of the best burgers you will ever have in your lifetime.  Go straight for the Kobe Burger!  But there are plenty of other items to pick from if you want to spend less or try something else.  You can build your burger however you see fit.  You get to pick not only your preferred cheese of course but also the type of bread and there are MANY toppings to pick from.  Not too many places let you put avocado on top of a burger.  Wash it down with a beer, a float, or one of their shakes.  You might find this menu much more useful than what you will find on the listed website.  It really will give you an appreciation for the toppings and other items like sweet potato fries.   http://www.usmenuguide.com/burgerbarmenu.htm  I wish I didn't have to go to Las Vegas to eat here.  Yes, the decor is very Fox and Houndish but the food is worth it.
1760	1	Super Fast service.....  amazing food. WHY DO WE NOT HAVE THESE IN THE BAY?!?!?  Ugh, totally worth the wait if theres a line....burger buns are like hawaiian rolls (i think) and these cheese fries, omg to die for! totes worth squeezing in the dress you'll have to wear later that night!
1572	1	Best french toast EVER!!!! OMG I'm still dreaming of coming back just for the breakfast French Toast! How do you guys make it Bouchon? I really want to know? Pretty please?! You guys just ruined every french toast that I'm about to eat after this.  No french toast would ever be the same.  Thank you!
1560	0	I got food poisoning from their food buffet on my 2nd day there, the entire trip was ruined. I reported it and the only compensation they offered was to refund my buffet.   On my second day there, I ate the breakfast buffet and noted to myself how the pork dumplings were room temperature instead of hot, I only ate one of them, this was about 9am.  By 3:30 I was vomiting like crazy. My wife did not have the dumplings, and she did not ever get sick, so I am almost certain this was not a stomach bug.  I called them back after a couple of weeks to check on the report I had filed, and they said no other person complained. Well here's the thing, with big companies, what does their legal team tell them to do? Deny everything and never admit to fault.  I am almost forty years old and I know when I have food poisoning.  I had to go to the Doctor while on vacation, and he agreed that, YES, my symptoms were in line with food poisoning. When I talked to Ashley from Treasure Island about the incident, she said basically that I could not prove that I got food poisoning there, and that is true, I can not go back and time and get a pork dumpling and send it into a lab for testing.  Sucks my first time in Vegas was ruined by poor food handling.  I will not be going here again.
1436	1	If you are in Vegas you must make Bouchon a stop on your list. Bouchon was actually one of the main reasons I chose to stay at the Venetian and beyond that it was the reason I chose further to stay in the Venezia tower.   I chose to try Bouchon for breakfast one morning and was blown away by the authenticity of this Thomas Keller establishment. Having been to Paris on occasion I can attest to this authenticity. Their croissant were better than perfect and maybe better than having one in Paris. Did I just say that?    I had the Croque Madame and Frites and it was again perfect. Just like the ones I have gotten for a quick breakfast in Paris at small bakeries. While I was eating in Bouchon we even had a French family dining nearby. No joke if I didn't know I would think I was in Paris. It was awesome.    Please promise me that you will try Bouchon. Even if just to stop by the bakery and grab a croissant. We were able to try two styles they offered; chocolate almond and strawberry. Yum delicious!
1623	0	unfortunately all the bad reviews lived up to the hype...being that it was my first time here it certainly will be my last, let's just say sizzler has a better buffet than here, the only thing that probably saved my not so great experience was the chicken dish and that was it, everything else was just screaming  cafeteria! Please don't waste your money
1929	1	I had to update, because we've been back several times since my last review. They've really turned the trashy counter situation around. It's like 95% squeaky clean now, which is great. The pizza continues to be awesome. We have never had to wait for more than a few minutes. I look forward to friends coming to town because that means we get to go to Secret Pizza. Happily upgrading to five stars!
1808	1	I love the Bouchon bakery. Any of the baked goods are amazing. The apple croissants are to die for, with a thick layer of baked apple goodness, and a perfect, flaky, buttery croissant underneath. The bacon scones are also delicious. I didn't actually have a meal here, but I can definitely vouch for the baked goods. Perfection.
1400	0	I gave Aria hotel a 5 star review for being fabulous, so it makes me sad to give its buffet 2 stars. The food was just awful and tasted like it came straight from an elementary school's cafeteria. There was nothing I enjoyed except for the decor and cool multi-color lights, and believe me I tried about 90% of the food. The crab legs were so salty I did not even need butter, and the consistency was almost like that of imitation crab meat.   To add salt to the wound, there wasn't even bottomless mimosas added to the $30 per person charge. Tisk tisk. Don't buffet managers know that in order for customers to eat crappy food, they need to be a little intoxicated?
1671	0	The worst experience at a buffet I've had in a long time, from beginning to end.   The girlfriend and I visited because we had a Groupon (probably should have been the first hint) and and we didn't feel like cooking. We read the reviews before we bought the Groupon. I just thought the bad reviews came from those who were a little too picky (I was wrong.) So we went with a clear mind, willing to give this place every chance it deserves.   Service (scale from 1-5, where 5 is excellent) - 1  We arrived, and walked up to the cashier. Boy, she must have been having a bad day; not the attitude I expect from a restaurant. No smile, no hospitality whatsoever. Kinda made me feel like I want wanted there. Anyways, I got over it, we stood and waited for the host to show us to the table. Her attitude was not much better. Ugh, not a good start. We waited about five minutes before our server came and took our drink orders. I swear, there must be a theme to this restaurant or something. She looked like she was barely tolerant of our existence. Expected so, the worst service I have ever experienced. We hardly saw here throughout the dinner. Even when she saw us waving her over, she would ignore it.   Food - 2  Now let's get to the food. Oh...the food. The only thing that was good there were the crab legs, the shrimp cocktail, and the charcuterie. That's because you can't really mess that up. Everything else was just downright bad. The prime rib was completely overcooked and tough. The baby back ribs were overcooked and hard. The bread they served were rock hard. Pretty much nothing in their hot stations that we had were very appetizing. We hate to waste food but sadly, most of the plates that we got were full when they took it away. We read that the saving grace is the dessert station. Not necessarily. Well, they do have frozen custard, which is the best thing there. They also have a Macaron cookie which was done pretty well. They have maybe ten varieties of cupcakes, and are way too sweet in my opinion. The fruit tart, stale. The crepes in the crepe station are pre-made packaged.   Value - 4  I give this a four given that the deal was from Groupon; $35+ for two people, alcohol included.   All in all, a pretty horrible experience, which prompted me to leave a review. I think they should seriously look into the service part of the establishment. It can make or break an experience, and on this occasion, it shattered it beyond repair.
1060	1	Went here for the first time and it was great!  Dining experience - 5/5 I mean it's KBBQ/Yakiniku style so you cook everything yourself which is always fun and awesome because you can control how you want your beef/steak done   Taste- 5/5 they have a variety of meats/seafood/vegetables you could throw on the grill including Kobe style beef which just melts in your mouth  Cost-4/5 not bad the only pricey item was the Kobe style beef which is ok, could be a little cheaper (comes with 5-6 slices=$21.95) they also catch you on the little things you'd expect to be included with your meal (sauces, rice, etc. they do come with complimentary small side dishes like kimchi, mac salad, etc.)   All in all it was great! Also if you were to write a Yelp review you get a free desert!
282	0	We arrived at 8:30 pm and the restaurant was busy, we were told it would be a 20 minute wait and 10 minutes later we were seated in the bar area. It would have been nice to be given a choice. We decided to order entrees since it was late. The dinner service was poor the entire night. To begin, my family is French and have lived in the US and ordered water without ice from the server. The busser arrived with the water glasses and they were filled with ice, they asked the busser to bring water without ice and he rolled his eyes and said he would let the waiter know. He eventually returned with two glasses and we assumed he would return, with the other two, he never did. He was asked later to bring a glass with no ice. We inquired about the wines and the server could not offer any information except to try a cab.   The server suggested adding the salad bar after we ordered. It was very disappointing, two of the trays were empty and a few other trays were almost empty. I was happy I did not order the  buffet.  We were in the middle of eating our salads and the entrees arrived. It would have been nicer to have enjoyed the salad. When the food arrived the tables were so close that we had to handle our own plates as the server could not get behind our chairs to put down the plates. The filet mignons were dry and when asked for extra sauce the server returned and said it was impossible as the sauces were cooked to order with each filet. The skirt steak was flavorful and juicy. The bouillabaisse  passed the palate test.   Will I return? No. The  level of service was poor for the price that was paid. The second night when we walked by they attempted to entice us with a special, we all walked by, especially after I apologized for recommending Pampas. I also noticed that there seemed to be a lack of servers with meats for those who chose the rodizio.
1488	0	The only reason why me and my crew came in here was because the guys wanted to watch football and there was enough seats to sit 6 of us. I feel bad because for the server because we were a larger group and we really didnt order much.   My boyfriend ordered a smoothie, which was so gross we sent it back after 2 sips. Our friends got spinach artichoke dip which I had a chip and the chips were like border line stale if you ask me. My other friends had a sloppy quesadilla which I could smell sitting 2 seats away from them.  I ordered nothing. I would never eat at this place. Overpriced for fatty, nasty food.
1925	0	We waited in a line and paid $28 for our dinner - plus an $11 all-you-can-drink option!   On a positive note the drink option is awesome and they have a literal plethora of food. They also had hot steamed crab legs which was a huge plus. Unfortunately there wasn't anything I thought was delicious. They really had a problem keeping hot food hot and cold food cold. I would not recommend this to anyone with taste buds.
1058	0	Food quality: 1.5 out of 5 Price: 1 out of 5 Ambiance: 4 out of 5 Service: 1 out of 5  Highlights: Overpriced, mediocre Chinese food with bad service. You are better off going to Panda Express at the mall.  * * *   Okay. Let's preface this with the fact that I am an Asian American raised in a part of California where good Chinese restaurants can be found in unusually high concentrations. I'm used to my wonton noodle soups costing somewhere from $6 to $12, with excellent quality. I'm also used to service being spotty at Asian restaurants, so that isn't really unexpected.   My girlfriend and I came in for lunch, craving some tasty hot noodle soup. We sat down and got the beef brisket noodle soup and the pork wonton with chicken broth noodle soup. The Total Rewards pricing for each was $15.99. (Side note: Everyone should get Total Rewards pricing since it's free to get a card from the casino and works at half of the casinos on the strip.)  The price was already a little over the top from what I would pay for great noodle soup. But our craving was strong, and we knew our options were limited.   Sat down. Waited several minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Finally got our order in. Only took about 5 minutes for the food to come out.   The beef brisket noodle soup was oily beef broth. Not the kind you would want to drink a bowl full of. The noodles were not bad, the beef pieces were ok. Overall, the broth really killed the bowl for me, and the fact that it was a $16 bowl.   The pork wonton noodle soup had a lighter broth. It was definitely drinkable and tasty, but the wontons tasted really off. Like they weren't made out of pork. The noodles were the same house made ones. There was random pieces of seaweed and tiny dry shrimp. A weird mix but not completely surprising from an Asian bowl.   Overall, not worth the price or even worth visiting. You are honestly better off going to Panda Express.

I ordered the pad thai...and what do I receive? Something that resembles chinese chow fun, but tastes like plaster. It didn't even remotely taste like pad thai...or chow fun for that matter. My fiancee ordered the char shiu noodle soup. ALSO inedible. The noodles weren't even close to being fully cooked and were still HARD. The broth was sooooo salty...Morton's called them and is asking for their salt back. My friend ordered the chicken fried rice. The rice wasn't even fully steamed before frying so it tasted like pieces of gravel. I can't believe the Bellagio would allow a product like this to be sold on their property. I will never go back again. That place was complete ASS. (and expensive!)  Oh, and no refills on soda? What the hell is that???
1553	0	Blah! Blah! Blah!  My hubby and I came here with such high expectations after reading/ hearing all the reviews... and boy were we ever disappointed... infact my hubby got kind of quesy after eating here and we returned to our hotel to sleep it off... Yet another buffet that I will not be coming to in Vegas
562	0	We chose to go here the day after the Las Vegas marathon because Mexican is always a good day after race meal because it's filling and we are usually starving.   I know it's Vegas and all but the fact that they want you to pay $4 to start off for chips and salsa is a bit crazy especially given that it's a Mexican restaurant. We ordered margaritas and I have to say that this was the worst $13 margarita I have ever had. It tasted so sicky sweet that it was undrinkable. It was almost as if it was all simple syrup mix and no alcohol.   We ordered the steak nachos and thankfully the waitress was wise enough and kind enough to tell us that the nachos would be enough to feed both of us. Boy was she right! We are by no means gals who eat like birds and these nachos could have easily fed 3 of us. So if you want to get your money's worth definitely order the Nachos. There is a nice heaping of guacamole on the top of these which is some decent guac but they are lacking in sour cream - there's very little drizzled across it. (I asked for some extra but it never showed up.) When we asked for some salsa for the nachos we were told it would be an additional $4.  Guys you'll be happy to know that the girls are dressed in a "bad girl" theme and are all pretty attractive. Our waitress was nice enough but the service was still lacking. I'm not sure where in Vegas the other Mexican places are but there has to be something better.
1048	0	Overpriced and not at all comfortable. (hard chairs and laminate tables) We tried the buffalo and the angus. It gets two stars because I am a burger and hot dog aficionado. Nothin special about this place. Even the sweet potato fries and chips were ho hum. And what's in that stringy sticky dippin sauce?
316	0	If I could give this place a zero, then I would. This was the most HORRIBLE dining experience that I've ever had. It is no surprise that they continue to move their business page!  Our cousins invited us to stay with them at their fantastic timeshare and we wanted to show our appreciation by taking them to a nice dinner. Earlier that day, I passed by Pampas and a hostess in front of the restaurant offered me a coupon. It was a buy one get one free offer. I inquired about the price difference between lunch and dinner, and asked that she explain what we should expect to get based on when what time we decide to eat. She told me that the main difference is that there would be 7 meat selections for lunch and 12 meat selections for dinner. We were all excited and looking forward to our dinner. It was a Sunday night, and we were sat right away. This was the only good thing about this night, no wait for a table, but here's the rest of our infuriating debacle. Our server, Karen, approached us a few minutes after we were sat and brought over a couple of large bottles of water. The caps were already removed from the bottle so we assumed that they were trying to be creative in how they served water. We later found out that they CHARGED US FOR WATER! We did not request water to begin with. She should have informed us that there was a charge before placing it on our table. Also, as you'll see on the attached picture that the bottle states that sparkling water is served in the bottle, but it was NOT sparkling at all. I asked Karen why they charged for water that we did not ask for and she said "Nevada has the worst tap water in all of United States, and I would never drink it." Obviously, her reply did not answer my question as to why they charge for something prior to informing us of the charge. BTW, it a minimal charge, but it's the principle.  Karen informed us that our coupon required that we buy a drink, so she goes on to suggest that we buy a pitcher of some type of alcoholic drink. I asked her if the coupon required that the drink be an alcoholic drink, and her response was "Well this is Vegas!" WTH!!! This girl was so irritating. I informed her that my husband did not drink alcohol, and she gave us a look of disgust. What she doesn't know is that it was only my husband who preferred non-alcoholic drinks, and the remaining 3 people would have ordered a bunch of alcoholic drinks, but the look that she gave automatically triggered us to order only the cheapest non-alcoholic drinks (with refills). Time to eat! The salad bar was horrible. It looked as if workers do not check the area to keep it clean. Totally looked unsanitary. Karen claimed there were 40 different types of food at the salad bar, and that was a totally false statement.  The meat options were horrible!!! I was already irritated by Karen's lies and up sales, so it triggered me to keep track of the number of meat options and again ... caught them in a lie! At the most, they only had 6-7 meat options that night for dinner. We asked Karen twice and another worker once if they can bring out lamb and they kept saying it was on its way. It NEVER came out to our table and we noted that it was not ever offered to anyone else. MORE LIES AND DECIT. They were charging us dinner prices for the same lunch options. They could have simply admitted that they did not have the lamb that we requested.  STAY AWAY from this place but if you're brave enough to try it, make sure that your server is not Karen, so that you'll hopefully have a more pleasurable dining experience. Karen's level of unprofessionalism left such a poor impression.
839	0	Ok, here's the scoop. We're Las Vegas locals and try and hit most of the Strip and off Strip restaurants, buffets included. We gave it a whirl for Saturday night dinner buffet.  First stop  ..the centrally located Seafood island. We got a sampling of crab legs, oysters on the half shell, yellowtail sushi etc. The crab was mushy, I also got a few bad oysters (mushy too), the sushi was passable.  Next we hit the rest of the lines offerings.  Skipping most to try a few items I normally like. Tried the obligatory Prime Rib, which was fine, but certainly not as good as a stand alone Prime Rib restaurant. Tandoori chicken was next.  The chicken was ok, but very dry. I then got a few slices of deli salami.  All were overly chewy and had a funny taste. At that point I went on to some melon , all of which were totally unripe and tasted like cardboard.  I finally went to the desert station and got a small sampling of baked goods. They were ok, but I have to say I was disappointed that they had no ice cream to complement the Bananas Foster. In all fairness they told me the machine was broken.  All in all, I would say the meal was mediocre.   The meal was barely passable, however we will not be making a return trip. My wife made the same comments to me. If you want a truly good buffet, try The Bachanal at Caesars Palace. It was NOT worth the price of admission.
304	1	This is probably the best Thai food I have ever had.  The menu is extensive, and I do not think you can go wrong with whatever you order.  I will share my favorites though:  * Tom Yum Kai Soup: a little sour, a little spicy, but a lot of flavor * Crispy Duck with Mint and Chili: very crispy duck skin flavored with just the right amount of spice * Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab: I am not sure why this is called drunken noodles, but it did not make me drunk. * Nua Yang Panang (Charbroiled beef with Thai red curry and cognac): This did make me a little drunk...
1713	1	This restaurant by far surpassed our expectations! We had the best service and food we've ever eaten at any restaurant.  We tried several appetizers including the gnocchi, stuffed lobster tail (which had lentils in bisque and it was phenomenal), pork belly, and beef tartar which comes out with garlic potato chips and was to die for!!   For dinner I had the beef Wellington and my husband had the american beef rib cap. The rib cap has marbling throughout so it was pretty rich, tasted fabulous!! The beef Wellington didn't disappoint, so much flavor!! Be prepared though, it does have a longer preparation time. For accompaniments we had the sauteed mushrooms (divine), Brussel sprouts, and Mac n cheese. My husband said the brussel sprouts were very tasty and the mushrooms were as well. The Mac n cheese was good, just a little heavy on the truffle.  Dessert had always been my favorite meal, so we had to sample a few. By far the sticky toffee pudding with caramel ice cream is the best dessert I've ever had!! It's worth the entire trip!! We also had the apple tart tatin which comes out nice and hot and the waiter places the wonderful cinnamon ice cream on top so it's served a la mode. The cinnamon ice cream is so smooth and delicious!! My husband is a peanut butter lover so he tried the peanut butter bar which he said was his favorite.  Our service was phenomenal!! We had Matthew and Derrick as our servers. They were extremely attentive and were always there before we even realized we needed anything. Matthew was also very good in knowing the menu and made some recommendations for us.   By far this is one of the best restaurants in town!!
551	0	Heard the frozen hot chocolate hype so had to try one with half oreo and half mochaccino flavors.  It tasted like chocolate ice milk with whip cream and a couple coffee bean candies and some crushed oreos on top ... which is fine.... but to me the atmosphere ruined the whole experience.  The tables seemed too close together and small ... at least where we were seated (directly across from the kitchen).  It also seemed a bit on the dirty side.  There was such an overwhelming scent of ketchup in the air, it ruined my desire for anything chocolatey.  Also, I wanted to wash my hands before eating and had to go outside of the restaurant, pass the patio area, and down some cavernous cement hallway to use a restroom.  I was expecting an elegant, old-timer ice cream parlor feel, but this place is no where near that. I can't imagine buying the $1000 sundae here. There were a bunch of teens hanging around a cash register by the door which was confusing because the waiter who just left the check didn't specify if he was going to take the payment or if we were to pay at the cash register by the door.  Sooo after waiting around awhile, we stood by the cash register while they asked us what our waiter looked like and then gave the payment to him.  No eye contact, "thanks", "come back again" from the waiter...so we just walked out. Overall I felt like I was just at a fast food place, but with exorbitant prices, grumpy waiters, & pretty plates.
1420	0	Came here with a 2-4-1 MyVegas coupon for brunch so the price was great, but the food was okay and service was spotty at best.   Large assortment for brunch, especially for dessert. The sushi before 10am freaked me out so I steered clear. Nothing was all that memorable from this meal except for the poor service (I had to get up and ask the waiters standing around chatting to get a refill on drinks).
983	1	What do you do when you are damn hungry and want to eat really tasty food somewhere on The Strip at 02:00 hrs? Well, you go to Grand Lux Cafe :)  I was staying in Venetian with my wife and was looking for some food joint near by. Grand Lux Cafe came to our mind since we liked the complimentary breakfast here. We ordered  Veggie Burger, Margarita Pizza and Garden Omelette. Here is what we liked about this cafe: 1. Food was just awesome. It was so tasty that we ended up eating a lot more  2. Serving size was much more than we expected(at least if I compare that to Gordon Ramsay Burgr)  3. Ambience is really really good  4. It is not costly at all  5. Wide variety of options to choose from. Me and my wife are eggetarian and even we could find sufficient number of options to choose from  6. It is open 24 hrs  Something not to miss in Vegas !
732	1	Delicious food and great service! We had the prime rib Benny and strawberry cream French toast. The potatoes that come with the Benny are soooo good; crispy and well-seasoned. Perry and the other staff were very attentive and friendly. :) I recommend if you have a larger group, call ahead and make a reservation  And don't forget to check in and get a free, warm banana nut muffin!
1933	0	Lee's is great for late night options when no place else is open. They're open 24 hours which means all the viet sandwiches and boba you want, anytime of day. They are like a lot of boba shops with the same kind of food and drinks. Their boba isn't cooked as long which is why I know a lot of people don't prefer their boba that way but I enjoy it! The one thing I'm not too fond of is their bread used on their sandwiches. Depending on what time of day it is, towards the end of the night, I usually get really hard pieces and eat on the insides of the sandwich. Service takes a while, even when its empty. Their card minimum is $5 so if you're only trying to get something small, bring cash with you.
540	1	Great service, delicious and fresh food (e.g. the squid in seafood pancake was supreme tender and fresh).would definitely return,but come earlier or.later to avoid the prime time. Only 11 regular tables so easy to end up with an hour wait. Totally yummy and worth it though!
1637	0	Rating is for customer service up front: Got here at 430 pm and the place is half-empty. Still have to wait 20 minutes for a table. I was told they dont have a table ready for service for a party of 6. Really?!?  Its Vegas and this is a touristy place.   And two ladies up front and so unwelcoming. Look bored/uninterested, Karen was on her phone, and pregnant lady seated other parties before us. Hope theyre not discriminating.  Finally got a table after I complained to manager. SMH.  Note:  Server is awesome though. Carrot cake is heavenly.
30	0	They have different sections of food, mexican, american, italian, chinese but not a big selection of each. And the food isnt the best. We went there bc of the unlimited beer, but it was only bud light and some other beer. It was too pricy for the selection if u ask me. $37 for dinner.
473	0	If I could give this place no stars, I would. The bouncers were rude, the people were rude, everyone treated you like you were literally a bug on the floor and they wanted to smush you with their big, fat egos. Hated this experience and WILL NEVER come back...you couldn't pay me.
72	1	You see that "R" by my name? I'm a regular here and I don't even live in Vegas. That's how much I've been here. Oh, do I miss the 7am breakfast after a long night... and I just got back from Vegas a few days ago. This was the closer of the night/morning. After a grueling night with the City of Sin, we, along with many others, find ourselves here at the Grand Lux Cafe. I think I've been here 4 times in 3 days.   The food is surprisingly very good! I ordered the pizza lunch special on my first visit and loved it. It didn't get me stuffed but I was full and content. Better than eating a buffet, where I always over eat and feel like crap come dinner time. Came back the next morning... or some would call it... a few hours later and had the "healthy breakfast" which consisted of chicken breast, egg whites and some veggies. I did not expect it to be good, and it wasn't but it wasn't bad either... it was healthy (understandable).   Had a legit breakfast here (like actually waking up in the morning and coming here). The breakfast buffet was excellent! The selection was very limited but the items that they have were all great. The hash browns were cooked to perfection, not burnt but not undercooked. The omelets were great too.   Lastly, had one last breakfast, this time it wasn't legit (due to the fact that there was no sleep prior to this breakfast) Don't know what I ordered, could be my lack of memory, or we can just blame it on the night.   Now to the service. It was excellent every time we were there (and I remembered). I must say though, our waitress for breakfast was absolutely wonderful. Definition of great customer service! If i knew her name I'd let you guys know... but the entire staff at the Grand Lux is amazing. Great service!
1216	1	I had been to the Shake Shack in NYC a few years back so I was so excited to see it in Vegas! I thought the staff was very friendly. The shakes are to die for! I recommend the strawberry. The burger tasted very fresh and homemade, which is my favorite. The fries are delicious too. This is a great place to order a meal and sit outside!
787	0	This place used to be pretty decent but we had the worst experience here this week. We got stuck in the West wing and our room was awful. I've stayed in better low end hotels like Motel 6 before. We were on the 5th floor and there has literally been a plate of room service waste sitting outside the elevators for the last 4 days! We will never stay here again!
1275	0	Worst check in ever! Been in line for 30 minutes, worse than the dmv. slots are tight, cocktail waitresses even more so! the best thing about this place is that its across the street from Circus Circus.  oh and the happy hour at the R Steakhouse! 5$ bowl of steamed clams, oysters, row of 3 sirloin sliders or habanero chicken wings.
146	1	Ordered the "Las Vegas" dinner for two, was worried it wouldn't be enough food for two but we were completely wrong, it was more than enough, essentially a sampler of an array of meats and side dishes they offer. Everything was absolutely delicious, steak, prawns, chicken, all the meat was very tender and you grill it yourself, great service.
1513	1	In a city where food spots must compete with the best of the best, a Thai place with thousands of reviews and 4-5 stars says a lot.  The restaurant is pretty large, with pictures of celebrities who've eaten there, covering the walls from top to bottom.    The restaurant has speedy service, prices a little on the high end for some dishes, but money well spent.  Lotus of Siam offered some of the best, quality Thai food I've ever had, an experience that will get me to come back in the future.  We ordered the  - garlic shrimp (skin like potato chips, fried perfectly it buttery batter; $27, but a most order): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=EmtQ-VHVShfszx-JszgebQ&userid=p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ - crying tiger, charbroiled beef with hot sauce and sticky rice (nicely marinated, tender charbroiled beef that goes well with sticky rice; careful with that hot sauce if you're driving home the next day - $17 dish): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=PdqT3DYEP3Au93n5zzShsg&userid=p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ - Tom Yum soup (spicy!): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xej3SJkCQu8Sh5K65E6eXg&userid=p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ - Coconut ice cream; a must!: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OjIQUqcaDDYGh8b8ZnF0Mw&userid=p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ  The entire meal was about $70 for 2 people.  While we could have eaten for less at one of Vegas many buffets and restaurants, I'm happy we got to experience this spot and I'm sure we'll be back for more in the future.
230	0	Once was enough for me. I am not coming back.  Not only is the service terrible, but the food is vastly overpriced, even for the strip. I waited about 40 minutes for ONE very simple, yet expensive dessert. I expected the quality to at least be great, but it was sightly above average at best. Nobody in my group was impressed.  In addition, a few of my friends recently received melted ice cream from this place. For a restaurant that is known for its desserts, that is unacceptable. Never mind, that should be unacceptable everywhere!  Satisfy your sweet tooth somewhere else.
1758	1	On our recent visit to Las Vegas, we were looking for a substantial lunch that would hold us over through the afternoon, past a show, to a late night dinner.  Our friends had recommended Holsteins, and as fans of Burger Bar and other fancy shmancy burger joints, we were eager to try out the menu.  Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, we arrived around 11:30 and were promptly seated at a nice corner table in the middle of the restaurant.  I started off with a Spicy Bloody Mary, which was made with jalepeno and cilantro infused vodka, served with a big old shrimp on top.  Spicy and delicious!  Our waiter (who was very good) brought us a bag of complimentary popcorn as we perused the menu  This place is really known for their burgers, as they well should be, but don't ignore the appetizers!  We wanted to try so many of them, but we settled on the "Sausage and Peppers" Potsickers and the Mexican Car Bombs (jalapenos stuffed with cheese, corn, and black beans, then wrapped in bacon).  The potstickers were unique and delicious, but the car bombs... O.M.G.  Sooooooo spicy, but so flavorful and delicious.  These things are no joke, they are very hot, so if you are a wimp when it comes to spice, these are not for you.  But we absolutely loved them.  For our main course, we decided to split a burger and another appetizer (I know I know, but we had to last 9 hours until our next meal!)  I had the Surf and Turf Quesadilla, which contained steak, lobster, Manchego Cheese, and bacon lardons, served with an aioli sauce.  Very yummy.  For our burger, we had such a hard time choosing, but we decided on the El Machete, described on the menu as "Beef Patty, Fire Roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Spicy 'Machete' Aioli".  The beef was medium rare as requested, and was perfectly juicy and delicious.  The burger overall wasn't as spicy as I was expecting, but maybe my taste buds were burned out from my spicy bloody mary and the jalepeno pepper appetizer.  Either way, it was good good beef.  We finished with a "grown up" milkshake... the Campfire S'mores, which I only had a few sips of because I was so full, but those couple tastes were very good.  They will also make it to go for you if you'd like.  Overall, we were thrilled with our lunch at Holsteins and it may be our new favorite burger place in Las Vegas.  Oh, and it definitely did the job of holding us over until dinner time.  We will definitely be back!
80	0	My fiance and I stopped by here and ordered from the to-go line. We ordered a pretzel which was awful. It was hard and dry. I had expected it to be warm, soft and fresh. We also ordered a frozen hot chocolate. It was expensive, not worth it, and I would rather have just gone to Starbucks and ordered a frozen drink.
1249	0	Not impressive. I went here for dinner with 5 other people and the line to pay for our buffets was enormous, but moved quickly. We were seated and a server promptly took our drink order. However, when she got back to the table, she had the diet and regular sodas all mixed up.  The buffet area is set up according different food "cultures": Japanese, Mexican, American, Middle Eastern, etc. Some of the food looked absolutely horrifying. My dad saw them mixing in snow crab legs with the king crab legs. Lots of stuff looked like it had been sitting out for awhile...  I found the only edible food in the Middle Eastern portion of the buffet. It had some couscous and fresh tomatoes sliced in half and topped with some sort of veggie concoction. It also had tandoori chicken and some really good vegetables.  I would avoid most of the meat here. Did not look appetizing at all...   They did have made-to-order crepes at the dessert station; I had a bananas foster crepe and it was pretty good.  Would I pay $30 to eat here again? Heck no. Especially if you can't eat much. If you're going to try this place out anyway, check around for coupons -- we found $5 off coupons available online.
155	0	Love the frozen hot chocolates but the service was really bad for us!! We sat down and waited for ten minutes and had to flag someone down to ask to take our order. "I'll find a server for you."  was his response. A family sat down right after and a server tended to them right away. We looked around and noticed that we were the minorities. Id hate to pull the race card but thats how I'm perceiving it. Disappointed is what I am.
1558	1	This is a great pizza joint. The best pizza ever? No, my heart belongs to Metro pizza and nobody can beat Metro. But this is absolutley the best pizza on the strip. It's just kinda perfect. Cosmo is my favorite strip casino and this place is the perfect place to start the night or end the night. Be careful if you choose to end your night there...there tends to be alot of drunken club-goers...which is great for people watching...most of the girls are a mess...they're either drunk, or acting drunk, shoes are off, hair is a mess, makeup all smudged and the spanx has given up! It's small and it's located at the end of a long hallway, so if it's busy and the line extends into that long hallway and it's full of those drunkin club folks, don't be surprised if someone vomits. Now that Those Guys Pies has opened in Summerlin, I do not have to trek to the strip for this pizza. Easily the best white pizza ever--definitely can't keep this place a secret.
1298	1	My girlfriend and I were really intrigued by this place because we're big fans of GR's tv shows and just the overall hype on his cooking history. This is probably the most excited we've been entering a restaurant. We expected top notch food and we got exactly that! Best onion rings ever and the burgers were insane; they had a very unprecedented flavor. We are definitely going back when we are able. 100% satisfied. From the atmosphere, to service, to the food... everything was what we expected and more. Burgr is fantastic and you should really try it. Freakin sensational.
1504	1	After a terrible dinning experience at the food court at Green Valley Ranch, I was pleasantly surprised by our dining experience at the Grand Lux at the Venetian.  I have been there several times and have always enjoyed it, but this was the first time we went with our 3 girls.  We got right in, had amazing service that went above and beyond to help make it a nice dinner despite having 2, 4 and 6 year olds with us.  The Cobb salad was as good a salad as I have ever had at a restaurant; fresh, high quality chicken, bacon and blue cheese.  Wife loved her smaller chop salad.  Girls devoured the edamame, volcano shrimp and sliders.  I spent twice as much on dinner as the night before, but felt like we got a bargain.  Can't say enough good things about our diner.
1675	1	Wow.  I can't say enough about this place.  The prices for good food on the strip are relatively steep, but the prices here were downright reasonable.  And the food was great.  The wait staff bent over backwards for me, and quite frankly, I ate most of my meals here over 5 days.  How could I do that?  The menu is HUGE, man!  I would strongly recommend this restaurant.
640	1	Literally the best burger I have ever had and I have tried a lot. The restaurant is beautiful with streaming flames that dress the windows.  You could sit at a regular table or at s high seat table. To top is off they also have the best sweet potatoe fires.  To add a sweet zing they sprinkle them with powdered sugar. From now on whenever in Vegas a stop at Gordons Burgr is mandatory !!!
1859	0	So NOT the buffet that I want when I got to Vegas (TAXI!!! quick! take me to the buffet at the RIo!)  After waiting for what seemed like forever in line that morning for brunch, we finally got seated.  Then we went thru the buffet - it was so so.  There was nothing spectacular about the food, nothing interesting, or unusual that would make it stand out - nothing that would make me ever want to come back.    Vegas is about trying new foods, and experiencing things, this was not something that I would consider new - or an experience.  it was just blah.
744	1	One of the greatest dining experiences I've had all year, maybe all life. Burger was succulent, excellent roll, each bite was juicy and delicious. The Oreo Milkshake had some amazing aftertastes, and the entire experience from onion rings to fried pickles was a heavy one.  I went into a food coma afterwards for about 1/2 a day.  We ate at 4 p.m., and I was done for the rest of the day!  Highly, highly recommended.
1839	1	Awesome place!! I looked this place up in YELP but was a little scared of the neon lighting and drinks shown in the first couple of pictures ONLY because I was traveling with my husband and our eight month old baby. Thought it would be more of a lounge than a restaurant. But I asked over at the Wynn where would they recommend a great restaurant for breakfast and they mention "Peppermill". I was then convinced and headed over. When walking in you can't help but see the neon lights and the purple furnishings. But once you actually sit down and your food comes to the table you enjoy the ambiance with the delicious food. Very good, would recommend and come here again!
165	1	Slow service so have plenty of time. LOVE the food here. I recommend almond boba, the ronin burger, steamed buns, fish chips, and hot sake. My kind of night! Art on the wall is cool too. This place isn't for everyone. Seating is a little uncomfortable and you can here everyone else's dumb conversations. You also have to have a palate for this stuff. Also, hard to see from the street so keep your eyes peeled.
777	1	LOVE this place.  Not only is it in my favorite Las Vegas hotel, The Cosmopolitan - but it exhudes that feeling of farmhouse crossed with Americanized swagger.  Walking in to a big cow at the front entry - you KNOW there is going to be some serious beef/meat here.  The menu is full of extremely inviting options.... right from the start.  You sit down to popcorn out of a tin, while choosing what to drink.  How a person can NOT have a milshake is beyond me.  And no, not for dessert.. but to start :)  Whether bam boozled or regular you cannot go wrong.  Remember all bam boozled shakes you can get without the liquor mostly, for 3 bucks less.  So.... even if you don't want the alcohol OR are still drunk from the daily festivities Vegas has to offer... you MUST get a shake.  Tiramisu, Vanilla, Drunken Monkey, Birthday Cake... grasshopper... all YUM!    Next is to decide on the main.  The salads are huge.  Everything is really.  The burgers are large and so so fresh.  Meat piled high on a fresh bun... with so many tasty toppings.  The steakhouse burger is amazing... although I could stand a few less black peppercorns.  The classic burger is even an smooth choice.  If you want a mountain of meat on a bun, they have that too.  OR if you are looking for something without beef... I guess that option is also available.  I don't think there would be a bad option - and I love finding out :)  The fries are okay... the sweet potato fries are better..  You can watch TV while in there... you'll get great service... and you surely won't be disappointed.  And truly the prices aren't THAT extreme considering you're in The Cosmo on the Strip in Las Vegas!
755	1	I took my girlfriend here for our one year anniversary last night. It was my first time there, but I had always heard great things about this place, so I figured I'd share this as another first with my girl and I'm glad I made that decision. There's a lounge where you can just sit and have a drink by the fire (the drinks were awesome!) And the cocktail waitresses were so nice. After a few drinks, we walked over to the dining room, which had a 50's retro feel. Our server Samantha was so nice. If you're looking for a nice place to go to for chorizo and eggs, pancakes, or any other feel-good food, come down to this place and enjoy!!
1844	1	I am traveling to Vegas for a convention. I also have Celiacs so I was afraid to eat anywhere for fear of being "Glutened". I was lucky to find this restaurant my first day here so I came back everyday for lunch. I am happy to say that the food was not only Delicious, but healthy for my food restrictions. The staff is really friendly and the atmosphere is casual but fun and clean. I highly recommend!
19	1	Hash House a Go-Go is our Favorite place to bring family and friends when they are visiting from out of town. Breakfast is served all day and our favorite meal to have there. We love when they order pancakes and the shock on their face when the huge plate arrives. Watermelon lemonade is amazing!   First heard about the restaurant  on the Food Network. Everything tastes home cooked and delicious.
962	0	I spent years driving by wanting to try it. Last October I went for my birthday and I was super disappointed. White chocolate frozen hot choco was too sweet and the carrot cake sundae was mediocre. I went again last night in hopes that they were just having a bad night when I went the first time. But I was let down again. The chocolate blackout cake sundae was overwhelmingly sweet once again with no depth to the flavors what so ever. I would have gotten the same effect if I made my own at home with Hershey's chocolate sauce. When I am charged over $20 for cake and ice cream, I expect it to be pretty outstanding which Serendipity 3 just can't seem to do.
69	0	The worst of the worst...... Omg....... Don't even think or get attempt by it from buy one get one coupon....  Horrible... Very narrow choices of food and taste is the worst.. Everything is either sweet or way too salty... I couldn't even eat two plates... Will never come back....
1331	0	115 degrees outside and a little face braced idiot with attitude tells us to wait outside. Inside looked like crap. Cheap tables all crowded together with LV worldwide destination sheep scarfing up lackluster food at ridiculous prices. The food was CRAP and overpriced beyond anything that Vegas has to offer. It's typical of Strip prices - these are all sheep and you must fleece them! They don't know that they can rent a car and eat good food in a one mile radius for 1/10 the price. I knew better but was walking in 115 degree heat and the kids needed to eat, so I drank the Kool-Aid.  $8.00 BudLight? $16.00 Chili Dog with canned Chili on top? YUP. SHEEP. Feed the sheep and steal their money. You think these morons from All Ports know what a a $1.00 Chili-Dog and an awesome American (ButtWeiser) costs? Nope. That's Vegas. The Strip lives on stupid sheep from everywhere. Sorry they stole from me in a bad situation but never again. We gave one of our chili-dogs to a homeless person eating out of the trash can...best part of my day.
1976	1	Hands down the best burger in the east. I went there at 5 5 p.m. Not a lot of people. I ordered a chicken mushroom something something better but they gave me turkey something something Burger when she was still good. But turkey scares the crap out of me, so it was interesting. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place
1821	1	If you're in Vegas and you're looking for KBBQ, you ABSOLUTELY MUST come eat here! This is the best KBBQ I've ever eaten. Literally everything was really, really good.   We ordered the Gangnam to split between 4, and subbed the miso soup for the kimchi chigae for no extra charge. It was enough food to provide us another meal. I really appreciated that the meats were fresh, had their own flavor, and were not overly salty. Food highlights/must haves: kimchi and bibimbap.   Staff here are super nice and accommodating!
1514	1	One of my favorite restaurants anywhere.  The Kobe beef burger is...um...well it's making my mouth water just thinking about it...  The Burger Bar offers a wide variety of burger choices, but the real fun is in the topping choices (ranging from the ordinary: tomatoes, pickles, onions...to the extreme: lobster, black truffles!!!).  Good drink choices (quite a few beers on tap) and wonderful homemade fountain sodas.  Excellent sweet potato french fries.    My favorite there, however, must be the "Chocolate Burger" dessert.  It's a warm glazed donut sliced in half (to look like a hamburger roll), a round slab of chocolate grenache, fresh strawberries, fresh mint, mango gelatin and raspberry syrup.  Great stuff.  If you're in Vegas, check out the Burger Bar!  Here's the website: http://www.usmenuguide.com/burgerbar.htm
429	0	This is for breakfast only.  I have to agree with Jax P.  Bland and soggy were the key words.  Service was subpar.  I asked for coffee, but nearly had to hunt down the server for cream.  There were a ton of bagels out, but no toaster or cream cheese.  The fruit was not ripe, the smoked salmon could have been much more flavorful, the sweets were completely unappealing and the cooked dishes were greasy.  The two roasted meats were the best things there.    The best part?  My stomach ached for hours after eating a small meal here.
1870	1	Because we saw Anthony Bourdain eat at Bouchon on "No Reservations" and rave about the food, we put Bouchon on our list of restaurants to visit. And we didn't eat there just once -- because brunch at Bouchon was so tasty on our first day in Vegas, we left Vegas on a high note and visited Bouchon again for brunch on our last day!   The restaurant has a cute, vintage bistro atmosphere with eye-catching tilework. The staff is great at seating guests near the windows by the courtyard during breakfast and brunch. And the homemade butter is so fantastic that you might just eat the butter by itself.   So during our two visits, we ate: -Croque Madame: it's like taking the most perfect eggs benedict you can imagine, replacing the types of bread, and then making the dish even more delectable and delicious.  -Brioche french toast: incredible! The toast pieces had no sogginess or heaviness; instead, the toast was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  -Omelette with salad: tasty and fluffy omelette with a fantastic mixed greens salad. The vinaigrette was flavorful yet light and was great for breakfast/brunch. -Pastries: this place knows what it's doing with pastries! We ate a chocolate croissant and pecan sticky bun at the restaurant and also enjoyed a macaron from the Bouchon Bakery stand in the Venetian on the main floor. Don't go anywhere else and order a pastry; get your pastry at Bouchon!  Put Bouchon on your list for Vegas breakfast/brunch places. If it's morning and you're hungry, go to Bouchon, and you will not be disappointed.
919	1	As I drunkly stumbled upon this place, there was no doubt that my nose had led me to this delicious pizza heaven. JK. But yes I was drunk, but a friend took us here. How could I call Vegas my backyard, if I barely just tried Secret Pizza!!  From what I remembered, the line was quite long, wrapped around the corner, but it was good for me to sober up. The interior decoration was fun, a couple machines for people to kill time with while inhaling that greasy yet mouth watering smell of fresh pizza. As I walked closer to order, my eyes widened and spotted the server tossed a freshly made Mushroom pizza in the bottom pizza drawer, I yelled (I think I yelled), I want that! Oh yes, it was filled with lots of fresh mushrooms and great crust. Wish I had ordered more, but man, it was pricy, but you do get what you paid for.   I am coming back again, hopefully more sober so I can actually take a decent picture and enjoy the pizza.
1625	0	I've been to Vegas a number of times and have never done buffets before. This time, I went to two. I was most excited about MGM's buffet because I'd heard so much about it, and I'm a fan of crab legs. I was so disappointed. The crab legs had to have been the smallest, most malnourished little babies I have ever seen. They were not flash cooked to help the meat pull away from the shells, so getting into them was almost impossible. While there is a large selection of food, I was not impressed with the overall quality. I wanted so badly to love this buffet because I wanted to make it part of my Vegas excursion every year, but this one just doesn't stack up for me. I think it is overpriced (about $40 per person) for what you get, especially given that buffets are in abundant supply in Vegas. So, I'm scratching MGM off of my list, but I'm glad I tried it.
112	1	Everytime I'm in Vegas I have to eat here. I always order the farm burger and the jalapeo poppers this this is the second time I have the hod burger and first time was good but plain. They now made it much better and now preffered over the farm burger. Not comes with jog patty, hog bacon and hog bbq pulled hog with so much melty cheese
1830	1	Well let's start with the service. Tamara was our server and we would like to give her 10 stars. The biscuits and eggs were also a 10. They have so many people working everything is do smooth. Packed house but a short wait. Best breakfast place in Vegas. We will be back!
231	1	I was in joy when seeing the sign while wandering around with the bf.  we're seated immediately at the comfortable table. As usual, I did the ordering, and my eyes are always bigger than my stomach.  We had chicken and waffles which was something different to try, but tasty,  steak sandwich - very good, fried calamari with rock shrimp - an excellent dish, salad & soup combo which was nothing special, we didnt  even finish half of it. However, each portion was way bigger than I thought. For the drink, my bf had beer, while I got orange & strawberry smoothie in a big glass was super good that I kept drinking instead of eating food, but still couldnt finish, therefore I had to ask my bf to suck it up 'cause I didnt want to waste it.  I love the service here, my waiter was nice, friendly & attentive, he came by few times to ask if everything was ok, and another gentleman which I guessed its the manager came over to check on us making sure we're well served. With an awesome service & food like this, I would love to come any time.
1700	1	Went here about a month ago.. Atmosphere Is like you're living on the set of the golden girls which I absolutely love! The food was great I had the eggs Benedict probably the best eggs Benedict I have had in a while.  The only thing that I have to complain about is the wait it took for us to be seated... Have no fear they have a full bar and fire pit to keep you entertained while you wait... James the bartender was AMAZING!!!!! He had great recommendations and was up for the challenge of being our bartender!!!! Overall, this was a great place and I will definitely be back!
1599	1	Best Thai food in Vegas! People take trips here via taxis from the Strip.   Food is dee-lish with a wide range of wine. I eat a lot of Thai food from LA to NY and this place sticks out!  Featured in Top Chef Master (Las Vegas). When I saw this episode, I was hollaaaaa-ing "I was there!!". This place is excellent and always packed. Way worth the trip; try everything! Come hungry.  Food: Sea bass with Pad Kee Mao (5/5) Drinks: 2 full cups of the best Thai tea everrrr!! (6/5)
1223	0	Save your money and go somewhere else. This place is overpriced and the food is subpar. That 2 for 1 yard drink special is not a good deal or even a decent deal. You get two yard drinks in a souvenier plastic container for $40! You can find way better deals at any bar in Vegas. The food is so overpriced it's not even funny. Something like $20 for a quesadilla. If you like overy loud music and a party atomosphere and you don't care how much lousy quality food costs then you might like this place. Otherwise, I'd never go back.
1462	0	On the positive side, this place has a great view, so if you're coming here, I recommend getting a seat overlooking the fountains and ordering beer and some shots.  The food is not good... we had an overly greasy torta and some very bad basic mexican dishes.
95	1	Most foodies know about the legendary Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas. All I can say is this...the curry here (specifically the Panang) is BY FAR the most exquisite Thai curry I have ever had. The nuance, the balance and subtlety of the flavors is incomparable. I've never had anything I didn't love and I've been going here for almost 15 years, but the Panang curry is truly a masterpiece of culinary excellence.
1897	1	We came here looking for a great burger and a great time and got both.  Walked in and got seated right away and had a nice waiter who was on the ball.   Ordered the Berry Fresh cocktail, the Jalapeno Margarita, and a couple beers (one was the house lager free when you check in with Yelp).   All came to our table very quickly and were quite tasty.  They don't skimp on the alcohol here.     I ordered the Gold Standard Burger and hubby had the Rising Sun.   I loved my burger and if you go upgrade to the Onion rings.  Huge, crispy and delicious!   Hubby was pleased withe his burger as well.  The tomato confit on both of them is awesome.     Food was quick and we were happy for less than 70 bucks in Vegas.    Enjoy!! Can't wait for our Holstein's to open in Portland!
717	0	It is as if someone wanted to bring the Laughlin experience to the Las Vegas Strip. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. However, for $250 a night, I would like a place with restrooms somewhere near the restaurants. A hundred small things make this a "never to repeat" adventure.
1415	0	My party of 3 waited about 15 minutes before we were seated on the patio on a Friday evening. We ordered a large pot of tea, Frozen Hot Chocolate, and Bread pudding to share. From my point of view, I noticed that this location is not well kept. You can definitely see the wear/tear of the restaurant. It felt dirty out on the patio and I would have preferred to be seated inside, as I noticed random patrons taking seats in the patio area. The desserts came 15 minutes later and we noticed that the bread pudding probably sat in the window for a while. That is, our topping of ice cream was completely melted by the time it reached the table.  Service was non-exisitent as well as the waiter hardly came by to check on us.   Overall, I was let down by Serendipity. The dessert are overpriced and I felt that slow service attributed my poor experience. Perhaps, the New York location may be able to redeem my perception of this chain someday.
210	1	Glad we set aside the time to dine in here while in Vegas. Had the garlic prawns ( so good I ordered another order after finishing the first plate), drunken noodles with soft shell crab, tom khai soup, curry duck were all excellent. You see any celebrity pics with the owner echo is cool to see. Lots of world renowned chefs all cosign this place and for obvious reasons.  Also, service was great. Very attentive and courteous. I will return and would recommend anyone who enjoys Thai food to make the trip out to this part of town.
1227	1	All I need to say is Beef Wellington and Sticky Toffee Pudding! WOW!  Both are signature Gordon Ramsey dishes and now I know why. The Beef Wellington is extremely tender!  Unfortunately, it was my husband's dish so I only got a couple of bites.  I got the 24 oz. ribeye and while it was good, the Beef Wellington was a lot better.  We, as a group of 6, was so FULL, we shared just one toffee pudding. Next time, I'm getting my own no matter how full I mean. Deliciousness.
1690	1	I was by myself on the Strip looking for a place to eat.  I came in here and the friendly staff suggested that I eat at the bar (full menu) rather than waiting 45 minutes for a table.  I got fantastic service at the bar, and the food was fabulous!  I highly recommend this place not only for the food, but for the welcoming atmosphere and great customer service.
1730	1	boyfriends family took us to dinner here since we were in town and we are sooooo obsessed! We are already planning to go back when in town again!!   We started with the oxtail chili cheese fries, truffle fries and onion rings! OMG! delicious! I swear the best truffle fries I have ever had cause they glazed the top with the oil too!   I had the Kalbi burger and the fam had the miso, black and green, and the bahn mi burger my burger was korean bbq goodness, with the kimchi and everything! A must try! I had a bite of all the burgers on the table and was not disappointed. Ended with the lava cake for dessert and that also was delish! order it when you order the burgers as it take about 20-25 min to make =)  definitely cannot wait to try the other locations (since they have different menus)   Loveee this place!
565	1	BEST THAI FOOD IN LAS VEGAS! This place is seriously amazing. It's off the beaten path in a pretty suspicious plaza. This place is always busy, we got there ten minutes before they opened on a Sunday for dinner and there was at least twenty people in line. It's totally worth any wait though. They have an impressive wine selection (a lot of rieslings) and everything on their menu is great. I always go with the Pineapple fried rice, spice level 8. It's so flavorful and the pineapple adds the appropriate amount of sweetness to offset the spiciness. A great appetizer is the crispy rice or the garlic wings. Seriously, you need to get the wings. The fried garlic is mouthwatering and the wings are so crispy. It's totally worth the trek over, if you're in Las Vegas and don't eat here you're making a mistake.
1635	0	This place is poorly run.  The people at register have two lines, one for platinum and one for regular customers. Both were empty so we thought it'd be fine to just ealk in through the platinum entrance because we didn't want to walk around the corner and have to follow some velvet rails, but apparently it isn't ok and we were told to go out and line up again anyways, a waste of everyone's time. Then they have a line for a waitress. What kind of buffet has seating waitresses? I've never had to be shown to a designated seat at any type of AYCA and this place isn't even busy. There's seating EVERYWHERE. Lastly for ll that, utensils are managed by the waiters. I couldn't get a new fork for this second dish that had vastly different food. I dont want my meat forks in my salads because it's greasy.  Foodwise, it's definitely not as good as it looks. Rhe selection is also really small for the price we payed, but it's Vegas so I expected as much. At least it looks nice here.
1256	1	As vegetarians, we ADORE this place. Nearly everything on the menu can be made vegetarian or vegan even if it doesn't say so. Just ask your server!   We had our first date here and every year we return to re-enact that beautiful evening.   Our favorites:   Crispy Rice (vegetarian style) -- truly amazing flavor, we could eat this all night. It actually paired very well with the  Papaya Salad (vegetarian version) -- delicious! Our only disappointment this most recent visit is we asked for Medium spicy and it was completely mild.   Mangoes & Sticky Rice -- luscious perfection! Never disappoints. I've been experimenting with making my own but they really have it down. The crunchy fried mung beans on top are a crispy balance to the chewy rice and ripe mango, and I have no idea how to replicate those at home!   I understand there are some low reviews from tourists visiting Vegas who may have had an uneven experience and felt disappointed, but as residents of Vegas who have dined here many times as well as at all the other Thai offerings in town, this place is the deal. If you had a less than spectacular time, try again. It is so worth it!   And yes . . . the parking lot is a little sketchy sometimes, but this has no bearing on my tastebuds. Go with a friend!
550	1	The people are right!  The food is fantastic and the coffee is great.  Strong and not for the light hearted. I asked about the chicken and waffles but was told the chicken Benedict was the most popular dish so I ordered it.  It can easily feed two and maybe even three people.  Everything was delicious and the portions are obscenely huge.   The wait was worth it although we heard the closer to 9am the more likely you'll get seated quickly. We arrived in Sunday at 11am and had to wait 30 minutes.
136	1	Tropical cocktails in colored pictures and in massive glass globes, pink neons lights cast strange shadows on the faux foliage, gilded mirrors makes the room look like a ballroom while the cocktail servers, clad in floor-length ball gowns and soft sex voices, sashay around the bubbling fire pit.   Strange place. But yes, I still take every one of my out-of-town friends here. Every single one.
333	1	WOW. This place which is located in the middle of a huge strip mall took my breath away. The minute my friend and I walked in to the restaurant after a long day of walking on Las Vegas Blvd, were surprised to see how big this place was inside. It was about 5:30 in the evening and half the tables were already taken. By the time we finished our dinner, an hour later, the restaurant was full.   Inside, there is a room with a huge selection of wines. The two seating areas were nicely done, typical to most Thai restaurants. The menu had good selection of authentic Thai food and French/American wine. The fried rice that I ordered with basil, tofu and vegetables was done right. The flavors were adequate and of good taste. Fried rolls for appetizer were standard fare but not too fried which is good. Just the right amount of crisp. The frozen banana dessert tasted good just like at most Thai restaurants.   Lotus of Siam is a local Yelp favorite and as you can see from the other reviews, its averages a little over 4 stars. Great place with great food and service.
1090	1	I will have to say this place has provided me the best steakhouse experience ever.  First thing you notice about this place is that the picture of the chef is not plastered all over the walls which is a great thing.  Let start will the bread that is given, 3 distance tasting breads with a butter that is quite a one of the kind taste.  Beef Wellington is incredible due to the fact that is it so flavorful inside the pastry it is cooked in.  Of course the sticky toffee pudding is really something that has be ordered.  It is really a dessert that you cannot find anywhere else.
228	1	If you are in Las Vegas and you are looking for a good and filling breakfast, try this place. I had eggs benedict with spinach, delicious! My friends had french toast which came in a big portion and were very good. Prices are ok, and lower compared to the places in the strip (this place is 15 minutes from the strip). Definitely recommended.
1569	1	We came here after reading the reviews and it was amazing! The place is clean. Service was good and quick. But most of all, the food was so flavorful!!! You've got to try this place! Amazing food with a huge menu which we can't wait to try next time.  Service was great and we were glad we can early on. Saturday as the place started to fill up.  Definitely recommended and now a favorite going forward when in Vegas!
1295	1	This is an exceptional Thai restaurant.  The food was fantastic, and there is a HUGE menu to choose from.  You have the perennial favorites like Pad Thai on up to the more rare things like crispy fried pork bellies.  We were impressed and wish it was closer to us.  Service was quick.  Even during lunch rush we had our food surprisingly fast.
993	1	This place was beautiful and amazing Doug and Alberto were my servers and they were positive and kind best thing is they were genuinely happy to be there and that's a huge deal to me when someone is serving my food. I sat outside and O M G the scenery! Such a pleasant well decorated garden and everyone around just in a good mood. The food was awesome I had the quiche!!!!! You have to try I've never had it like that before and it was the best quiche I've ever had. Period. So happy I came amazing and relaxing experience and non expensive I paid $30 for quiche side of spinach bowl of fruit fresh orange juice tp and side of hot tea. Can't be that especially for the awesome location
1330	1	A consistently excellent dining experience.  Though Thomas Keller has probably not set foot in the place for years, his aura clearly remains in the service and attention to detail.  Little things like the bread and butter are excellent, but Keller goes one step further throwing in a handful of still-warm house-roasted pistachios.    I played it safe this time, having my favorites-- oysters to start and the steak frites entree.  Both were excellent as usual.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well.  The only negative s something they have no control over-- the customers-- decked out in flip-flops, way-too-short-shorts, or obnoxiously loud shirts.  Ahhh Vegas.  P.S.  The breakfast and brunch rock as well.
1046	1	11:30am arrival. Seated within 2 minutes. Promptly got drinks and assistance. Huge selection of food with smaller breakfast menu served all day. Prices were fantastic for being Las Vegas and more accustomed to what we are used to back home. Service was wonderful and great customers service. Instead of the traditional crayons and coloring for kids they gave these wax strips in multiple colors that kids could create objects with. Super cool and totally different fro. Any other restaurant. Our waiter gave us a few packets to take home as well.   We had to wait about 20 minutes for the food to come to our table but thinking about how big the menu is and the amount of people in the restaurant I can't really complain. It was not that bad. The proportions for the food are HUGE. So much food for the price.   If you are in the area and need a great meal for a fantastic price don't hesitate to try the Grand Luxe.
154	1	Had an early dinner here with my bff.  We shared a liter of wine, and it was the best stinkin cab I have ever had.  Sadly, I don't remember what it was.. maybe cuz of the 1/2 liter of wine I had that night.  haha.    The food here is amazing!  Started with the hazelnut beet salad and wine glazed pork belly.. the salad had pickled ramps that were so tasty!  No strong onion flavor.. it almost tasted like asparagus with a light spring onion taste. And the pork belly was crispy and creamy at the same time!  Served with a ramp custard, the two were a match made in heaven.    For the main course, I had the pork loin served with a baked ramp custard, roasted Anjou pears and morels... To die for! Kinda tasted like Korean food.. which is a good thing.  Pork and green onion pancake (sahm gyup sal and pah jun).  My friend had the lamb, but I can't say too much about that since I don't like lamb.  :)  For dessert.. we had the creme brulee and Ill Flotante.  The creme brulee was pretty standard, but the ill flotante was like a fluffy cloud of dreamy goodness.  Haha.  it was soooo amazing!  airy meringue in a sea of anglaise and a little gravy boat of fleur de sel caramel sauce.. holy mother of all good desserts.    For the two of us, we spent close to 300.. yes, it's pricey, but for a splurge meal, it's as good as it gets!
202	0	We decided to try Treasure Island buffet as we had received a complimentary coupon from the hotel. I was famished when we arrived, and still, the food was just about inedible. Meats tasted frozen and had very cheap, been sitting around under the heating lamps  for ages, quality to them. We found a hair on our plate. The only redeeming quality, hence two stars and not one, was the dessert bar where the items were not completely horrid and inedible. Staff was pleasant enough. Will likely never come back - free coupons or not. Stay away if you prefer food that tastes fresh and edible.
896	0	This place sucks!  Ordered some beers at the bar waiting on a table to open outside, bartender was rude.  Get outside, waiter ok, but guy who brought our food was rude when he threw it on the table.  Waiter never came back to check on us after the food was ordered!  Love this place in the Bahamas but not in Las Vegas... No fun here! Stick to Senor Frogs in the Caribbean ...
1116	0	This restaurant looked really cool from the outside.  I guess I got sucked in by all the beautiful fishes in the fish tanks.  I also thought how bad can noodles be from BeiJin?  Whua, shocker!  It was BAD!  They said they the noodles were hand-pulled.  I know how hand-pulled noodles should taste.  These were not even close.  The texture were too soft and didn't have the Q (Al Dante) they should have.  The Pork and mushroom sauce were so little, I had to add soy sauce to the noodles in order to eat it.    The order of  'Beef Pancakes' has 2 and were the size of dollar coin.    Conclusion - very small portion, very expensive, and very bad food!  Don't be enticed by the fish tanks like I did.  WALK FAR FAR AWAY from this place!  It's not even worthy of 1 star!
1855	0	This restaurant had a big line to eat and the waiting system here is absolutely horrible. They make you stand in line for over an hour with no pager or any other system which would allow the guests to sit in casino or do something else. Also none of the restaurants in Bellagio including Noodles has a couch or waiting area which would allow the patrons to sit. This reflects a very callous attitude by bellagio where they dont have a couch or a pager system.   The food is OK. The 2 table besides the counter in the back isclose toeach other and there is very little privacy...  So overall a very dissatisfying dinner - 45 min wait with no place to sit and wait,  food is Just vey average and the waiter is very abrupt so cant give any points for service either.
1306	0	I had been there before years back. Great location , live country music something different , but the food was too bad to give it more than 2 stars. Service was quick and friendly but what they served was awful . Seemed like everything was old and flavorless. Like it was sitting around for hours before serving  even the baked beans made canned super market beans seem gourmet . Dried out ribs, something that was supposed to be steak and seafood that was a war crime . Pass on this place and enjoy many of the other fine places in town. They clearly don't care
1232	1	The best Thai food I had in long time.  I started with Sa-Tay of chicken.  Very good pickle vegetables and a delicious peanut sauce.  I enjoy it immensely.  My girlfriend had the Tom Yum Kai.  She really enjoyed the soup.  I was lucky and got to try it before she ate it up.  I agree, the soup was great. I had the drunken seafood noodles with spice level of 7.  It was spicy but satisfying.  The food was delicious and the spicy sauce was incredible.  We came pretty late but service was still very good.  Definitely, will be back again.
1703	1	The best BURGER in the world.  Yes, it is $10.00 more than a double double @ in-n-out, but the quality and the thickness of the beef is superb!  They cook their burger to PERFECTION, and you'll never find another place with this quality of beef.   Not only is the beef perfect, but also their toppings.  You get to choose ANY topping you like on your burger.  I always get avocado with mozzarella and satuee portobello mushroom.  MMmmm, mummmm, mummm.  My stomach is growling just thinking about it.  On yeah, you also get to choose the type of bread you want around your burger.  I always choose ciabatta bread because it's mostly crust with little dough in side.  I'm weird, I always eat the outside of the bread, but not the inside.    Bottom line, if you're in Vegas, you gotta come here and try their burger.  I assure you with one bite, you'll be hook and will always have to come back here for another burger whenever you're in town!
1751	1	After reading some less than stellar reviews, we almost canceled our reservations.  However, after talking with some Vegas locals and other friends that have dined at Ramsay's and gave it raving reviews we decided to check it out afterall.    We had reservations so when we walked up we were seated right away.  We were sat in a cozy little booth facing the kitchen so we got to watch the action.  One sous chef immediately caught my eye and I asked our waiter if he was from the show.  Yes!  It was Chef Jon from Season 11!  He was more than happy to come sit with us to take a photo and chat for a quick minute.  Super friendly guy.  Anyway, enough of the fan geek moment, to the food!    The bread sampler looked fantastic.  Being gluten intolerant I wasn't able to taste it, but my husband said it was very good.  We got the shrimp cocktail appetizer.  I'm typically not a fan of shrimp cocktail, but this was something else.  The shrimp were huge and great flavor!    Husband got a seafood plate that had scallops, mussels, lobster and other things on it.  The scallops were TO DIE FOR!  Perfectly cooked, OMG.  I can still taste them.  I ordered the filet and it was melt in your mouth tender.  I ordered asparagus as a side because I have to have my veggies.  Even though it was nearly $20 for 10 or so stalks of asparagus (so plenty to share) they were seasoned and cooked perfectly!  Some have commented that the music was too loud in the restaurant.  I thought the level was appropriate.   I can't wait to go back!
1988	0	This is a review for the cafe part of Citizens, not the actual restaurant.  Hungry after a night of partying and wanting something of sustenance in our systems before hitting Daylight, our group wandered into Citizens to pick up some food.  Between Boyfriend and I, we got a bottle of water, a fresh fruit bowl and a croissant. And it totaled to just over $16. WHAT. WHAAAT. The bottle of water itself was $5. FIVE DOLLARS. Even my croissant was only $3.50 (ONLY, she says). My poor wallet.  At least the food was okay. The croissant was light, flaky and huge, so I suppose it kind of made up for the price. The fruit was pretty good -- but unless it's spoiled, it's kind of hard to mess that up.  The other members of our group got various salads (I distinctly remember seeing the quinoa salad) and a tuna sandwich. Their food looked pretty good, but I didn't try it. Regardless, I didn't hear any complaints, so I suppose it was decent enough to satisfy our appetites.  Next time, I think I'll just go hunt down either a Starbucks or something instead if I'm craving a croissant. That's just ridiculous.
814	1	Best breakfast buffet for the money on the strip. For $18.95 you get unlimited omelette station, waffles that are so fluffy you think you are in heaven, bacon, sausage, hash browns, fruit, cold and hot cereal. A must if you like breakfast.  #bestwafflesever!
438	0	I won't write too much about this buffet. It got the job done as far as filling our tummies but it was nothing amazing. The only thing it had going for it was the mimosas and even those were meh...ok. Just expect your run of the mill cafeteria offerings and you won't be too disappointed.
523	0	Ugh. The friendly staff gets four stars but the building is atrocious. Decor is beyond tacky, elevators are scary, and the whole place needs an upgrade badly. Yeah, sure its cheap and not the MGM but the only reasons that I can think of anyone wanting to stay here is if they're really tight on budget or just want to ogle young girls in ridiculous outfits while gambling. At least the rooms don't seem to have bedbugs.
1108	0	fine, the ice cream is pretty great. i'd recommend getting one sundae to share with three people. there's a reason they are around fifteen dollars and it's because they are seriously huge. they are all delicious. oh and i tried a really great strawberry milkshake too! though those are regular size and also ten dollars.  the wait is always long, though the takeout window seemed to be moving much faster than our wait time for  table. it also took a really long time to get our food, even though all we got was sundaes and a milkshake. didn't mind since the place is nice to hang out.  two stars because our waiter hated us. maybe because we just ordering desserts and he's used to bigger orders, but even with that we were spending at least forty dollars. that was kind of annoying since we weren't even spending extra time there, just waiting for our food. i have to say that soured the experience a little. if i'm ever back here again, i'd probably do the takeout window. but the ice cream really is good.
1055	0	Cafeteria style food. To say it was mediocre would be a compliment. Hands down, the worst buffet experience I've ever had. You're in Vegas! There's lots of good places to eat - avoid this place. You're better off eating at the food court in the Luxor.  If you actually enjoyed the food and selection here and thought it was actually good, you should get your taste buds examined. Seriously.
53	0	I made the mistake of having such high expectations of China Poblano because they were just completely crushed.  I had heard so much about  culinary genius, Jose Andres and that is the reason I even went into the restaurant after perusing the menu.  If it was not associated with Jose Andres, I would have immediately done a 180 after seeing the $11.00 price tag on a serving a dim sum.    Jose Andres is known for his tapas servings and so our group ordered a number of tapas servings to share.  And they were just OK.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing either.  If I am paying $8 for a mini mini pork sandwich- it BETTER blow my mind, and it did not.  My favorite dish was the eggplant dish, but it wasn't fabulous enough for me to return. I even tried eating the Chinese dish and Mexican dish, side by side to see if that would make a difference in the "experience", but it didn't.  In fact, I still don't get it.  It was not a fusion restaurant, but rather two menus in one.   The ambience is cool and trendy, but next time I am considering Mexican or Chinese, I will definitely go elsewhere, where the flavor satisfaction matches the price.  I can get ambience elsewhere.

539	0	Not a fine dining of course, it's more of a causal grab a bit kind of place. The Singaporean noodle was good. Spring rolls were average. I expected a bit more from the place in terms of food quality in lieu of it being in Bellagio. PS mango pudding was okay too!
659	1	This morning I brought my mother and daughter in for breakfast. We had Oscar as our server. Oscar had a great attitude from the second he came over to our table. He was very attentive and friendly the whole time we were there. Food was awesome as always, just wanted to make sure Oscar was recognized for his great service.
1782	0	I get stuck here when I have to work the convention center trade shows. The rooms are craptastic. Small, tattered and lame. One time my drawers kept sliding open because the freakin room was so slanted!! They put plasmas in the room but that couldn't save it.   To make things worse, they have Barry Manalow plastered everywhere with Copa Cabana blaring where ever you go... A Benihana onsite, proximity to the Convention Center and GREAT sports book save this place from one star damnation.
1166	1	There are lots of great reviews on here so I will just confirm that it's amazing and that you must go. Get the croque madame!  The tips I have are that it's a bit hard to find, go to the check in area and take the elevator tucked in the corner to the right. Also, the doors to the pool area don't require a key card so it's a great space to lounge while waiting for your table. We went on a Sunday morning around 11am and only had to wait about 20 minutes, perfect experience.
77	1	The Gold Standard burger lives up to its name and more. Possibly the best burger that I have ever had in my life!  Their shakes are a fun treat as well. The Apple Pie is one of my faves, with real bits of apple, making it literally taste like they shoved an entire pie in a blender with some rum and ice cream and served it in a giant glass. Also, they give you the extras, so you're really having 2 milkshake glasses instead of one. A tiny girl like me can take one down and be content for the rest of the evening.  Here's a fun tip for you club-goers: Head to Marquee early and get your stamp. Once you're in, get your drank/dance on for a bit and then leave to go to Holsteins downstairs for a mid-club snack. When you're done, go back upstairs to Marquee's re-entry line and dance the burger/night away. Best way to spend a night in Vegas.
1533	1	I've been to Bouchon twice now.  The first time was so amazing, I practically planned my next trip to Vegas around my dinner at Bouchon.  While the service left something to be desired on my recent visit, everything else was as exquisite as I remembered it.  Walking into Bouchon I hardly feel like I'm in Vegas.  The dining room is beautiful with big windows and a long metal bar.  It feels like being in Napa, and coming from California, it feels like home (albeit a home much nicer than my own).    On my first visit the service was spot on.  We had at least five people helping us, but they never mixed anything up and it never seemed intrusive.  We also had a four person table for the two of us, which was great since we ordered so much food.  When I went recently, my waiter was very, very slow (both in his service and his speech, which included many, many uncomfortable pauses).  Both times I was particularly impressed by the sommelier, who is adorable, funny, and extremely knowledgeable.      My first trip started with olives, the salmon rillettes, and the goat cheese salad.  I could have done without the salad (it was good, but very simple and too similar to things I make at home), but the olives had a great smoky flavor and the salmon was just fantastic.  I wanted to ask if they would sell me a jar of the salmon to go, but I thought they might be grossed out.  We also ordered a bottle of the sommelier's choice wine--a really fantastic syrah from Oregon.    For our entrees I had the steak frites and the boy had the mussels.  Both of them were amazing, but I preferred my steak to the mussels (and I really love mussels).  They both came with a giant side of frites, which I was honestly a bit disappointed by, given all the raves I'd heard.  There were just too many of them and they seemed slightly undercooked.  Still, that didn't detract from the meal at all.  My second meal started with the salmon (I'd been craving it for months, and it was just as good as I remembered) and the fois gras.  I know fois gras is evil and decadent and I'm suppose to hate it, but my god was this some delicious fois.  The outside was glazed with the most amazing strawberries, which accented the creamy inside perfectly.    For our entrees we had the lamb chops and the scallops.  The lamb had a peppery sauce I wasn't too fond of, but the scallops had another summery fruit sauce that was perfect.     Both times, dessert at Bouchon was good, but not the highlight of the meal for me.  I've had both the chocolate moose and the beignets. The moose was very dark and rich, but I preferred the cream filled beignets.    Small details like the plate of cookies they bring out with your coffee only add to the experience of Bouchon, leaving you entirely satisfied.
359	1	I seriously dream about this pizza.   On my last few trips to Vegas, Secret Pizza has been one of my first stops every time. One slice is never enough (even though they are HUGE.)  As a pizza connoisseur, I vote that this is the best of the best. You will not be disappointed I promise. And if you are, then we can't be friends.
1726	1	Granted, I've only eaten here for breakfast, but what a fantastic breakfast it is.  The croque monsieur is easily one of the best things I've ever eaten, and the fries here are some of the best.  The specialty omelettes here are also out of this world - it doesn't seem like there is really that much that can be done with eggs, but Bouchon manages to find a way.   I love the atmosphere here early in the morning - its fairly empty, the staff is formal but still relax and not stuffy or annoying, and it all equates to a very nice, very relaxed breakfast experience.    A breakfast here also won't break the bank...it's not exactly cheap, but I'd much rather spend my money here than at a place like Grand Lux or Hash House.    I can't wait to try this place for dinner.
275	0	Being in Miami there are a lot of hot dog places which load up your hotdog with tons of yummy goodness stuff (try the green or pineapple sauce).  So I am used to eating a loaded hot dog...if you can, try it with quail egg.  This place? Why go when you have amazing restaurants all around you.  I get that its a cheaper alternative to the $40 plates around you.  But there is a reason why the hot dog costs $8.  If you are going to go cheaper, maybe just hit up the McDonalds thats located on the same strip.  Its not that this place is terrible or anything.  Its just not great.  So why waste your money or your calories?  The staff is nice and the place feels clean so that is a plus.  You can sit outside and people watch.
596	1	The food is super-rich.  You will get very full if you attempt to eat everything on your plate.  I have ordered pasta and steak and both were excellent.  I would say the pasta dishes are the way to go, as the few sauces I've ordered were very good.  I got a bite of my wife's iceberg salad and it was very good as well.  They serve Cheesecake Factory dessert, so try to save enough room.
1716	1	I had lunch there last week and it is still one of my all-time favorites.  Salmon burger with sweet potato fries is always topnotch.  Salmon portion seemed to be a bit thicker than usual but it was cooked perfectly.  It is one of the best cuts of salmon I have had at any restaurant.  Sweet potato fries were crispy and also some of the better ones I have had.  Lunch with 2 beers was less than $20 - great value.  By the way, sit at the bar if you can.  It often makes for interesting conversation.
386	0	Not much to say other than the food was terrible. My hamburger was the driest hamburger I have ever eaten and it gave me a stomach ache. My friend ordered the Mac n' cheese and she immediately got food poisoning. Needless to say our trip to Vegas to celebrate her birthday didn't go as planned after she got sick from the food. As a result we didn't even try the dessert, which we were excited for. The service was okay but not enough to give this place more than a one star rating.
1074	0	Rooms are decent and the beds are VERY COMFY! Free access to the pool and amenities when we went.  Downside: Our toilet was spewing like a geyser and we saw a humungo roach crawl across the floor. Called maintenance/front and they acted like we should've expected it....that was after the 3rd call to them. WOW!  Tip: Try the raspberry mojito at the pool bar. The 2 for 1 drink specials are gonna get you snockerbockered!
373	0	I stayed here last month and this hotel is definitely a "you get what you pay for" hotel.  It's very small compared to the gigantors surrounding it. You can stand at one end of the casino and see the other end very clearly.  Their giftshop by the entrance seemed to never be open.  The room I stayed in had one power outlet and it wasn't by the desk.  The bathroom door didn't fit through the door frame for some reason so it wasn't able to shut.  The air conditioner didn't work but I didn't mind.    I gave a star for the room service ladies and gents.  They were always greeting me and offered towels galore.  The second star is for their mini 24/hr convenience store located by the elevators and pool entrance.  Everything you need is in there.    Speaking of the pool, it doesn't look like what it does in some of the yelp photos.  I think they renovated it and now it's just two pools. The waterfall and two "mini" pools are gone.   Overall, if you're on a budget and want to splurge on other things and just need a place to sleep, this is it.
353	1	This place is swamped but well worth the wait... People can knock on this place but lets be honest they make damn good food and the portions are definitely some of the largest you can eat.    If you show up and the place is banana's (btw banana latte is legit) then try to check in and flirt at the bar and you might get lucky and seat yourself without the wait (your are welcome).  The meat loaf is crazy good, there are a few options of having it, I have owned some and they are tasty.  The Chicken and waffles are amazing!  Love coming back to this place when I can.
793	1	Great food. Great prices (for the strip). Line was long, but moved fast. We had to wait for a seat, but eventually we got one before food was available for pickup. We went around 8:30 pm on Sunday night (Labor Day weekend). Wife and I shared Shack Stack burger and cheese fries. We had complementary water. Burger was really great. Portobello was loaded with cheese and popped when cut in half. Meat was cooked just right. Wife did not like cheese on her fries; I did. I am happy that Shack Shack is coming to Downtown Summerlin.
1650	0	I was severely disappointed in the food and service at Pampas.  This sort of sums it up: the lousy Margherita that I ordered as soon as we sat down did not come until we were almost done with the over cooked dinner.    Surprise!  The salad bar has a nice selection of items. This creates a false sense of what the meal will be like.   But reality set in when the waiters started to serve the rodizio meats on the skewers. Only one item was medium rare, the sirloin steak.  Other than that, the chicken, sausage, lamb, pork, filet mignon ( a crime to ruin a good cut on beef), ham and other unrecognizable rats were over cooked, dry and tough.  Shoe leather would be more tender.   Wait I am almost done and my Margherita finally arrived. I really need a drink to digest this food. I take a sip and wait, when did 7-11 start making Margherita icee's?  The drink was all crushed ice very little drink. I guess it is a fitting cocktail.      Oh no. The bill just came. They put different tip suggestions based on different percentages.  So the bill was $102 and the 20% tip is $33.40?  What type of math are they using???   On top of everything, Pampas is expensive.  $70 per person.  Save yourself some money and go to a Mc Donald's .
937	1	The saddest awesomeness thing happened here .... I came to vegas alone and I told the cashier named Jarde that my bday was comming up in a couple of minutes she was super nice I kid you not she went to the back and gave me a free Ice cream ... Dude this is amazing costumer service! Give this chick a medal or something   Thank you!
1163	0	I was honestly so dissapointed when I ate there. I honestly do not know what everyone was fussing about how it's the greatest thing in the world.  Cons: The line was long, (as suspected since it's new) once you get inside, there's another line. I don't know if they still have long lines since people know it's not the best lol The burgers were tiny and had very little taste to them, which I assume it's how it is in where it came from. It was very expensive for what you got to be honest. It was not good at all, way way over price. Like In-n-Out is better lol The kitchen where you can see them cooking the burgers is very unsanitary looking. There were buns everywhere, chopped onions on the floor, not to mention their was pretty brown lol DO NOT WORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THERE, YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING.  Pros:...umm they have really good chicken rings?  Hope this helps. I honestly would recommend to go there just to taste it just so you can say you've had it but I honestly doubt that anyone is going to return. Unless you're a tourist and drunk at 4 in the morning.
417	1	I'm from Chicago and have also had a lot of New York City pizza but this place is by far better than any pizza ice ever had!!! We've eaten there almost everyday!! Great little hole in the wall! Hidden between two restaurants on the 3rd floor! There's no sign, just follow the long hallway with a ton of pics on the walls! Pizza slices are $5.50! Amazing!! Loved the white pizza!!! Best little gem in Vegas!
1355	0	pretty much horrid.  this is NOT fusion food.  it's basically chinese food juxtaposed with mexican food.  the waiter asked us if we wanted chips and salsa and we said yes, like we would at any other mexican restaurant.  little did we know we'd be paying $4.  poor ger-ger wanted guacamole not having seeing the menu and didn't realize it cost $15!    extra chips?  another $2  shu mai that taste like it came from costco, six little pieces, $14.  what a rip off.  never again.
1586	1	Loved this place.  Went twice on my latest trip to Vegas and each time was great.  Had the gold standard and the long horn burger and each was fantastic.  The philly cheese steak rolls are to die for, but the artichoke guac is a miss.    Beer selection is off the charts and the servers were attentive and fun.
1289	1	I definitely would give this place a five star. Wait staff is attentive and the food was delicious. Hands down the best Thai food I've had ever! We waited an hour to eat but we were seated at the bar while we waited for a table. Great spot to converse and drink wine and beer.   The food did not fall short of expectations, it actually surpassed it. The atmosphere was very appealing. From the outside it looks like a hole in the wall, but it was actually very roomy and the decor was beautiful. Not to mention all the pictures of celebrities in their restaurant.  I would definitely recommend their crispy duck Panang curry and soft shell crab drunken noodles. You cannot go wrong with these dishes. It's very appealing to the taste buds, I never knew duck could taste so good!!!   I look forward to becoming a regular here!
1770	0	(...one-star for my girl who kept her cool when things went to sh*t...)  *sigh*  I used to like Tao.  Used to.  Past tense.   But the reprehensible and abysmal customer service we recently encountered on numerous fronts border on cataclysmic.  Ill Communication... (Beastie Boys, 1993) 10 days prior to Vegas, more than one person in our entourage attempted, valiantly and persistently to secure guest list accommodations, all to no avail, no recourse, no reply, no acknowledgment from Tao staff/management.  Fine... it happens.  The Tipping Point... (The Roots, 2004) So, uncertain of our status on the guest list, we made a conscious effort to arrive early to stand in line, arrayed in a 16 girls to 6 guys ratio, the ladies looking delectably hot and the gents dapper smooth (or at least passable... meh!). For over an hour prior to opening, we stood there (at the front of the line), as did countless others behind us, until a security/bouncer announced, "regrettably" of course, that they had over booked the guest lists and no general admission guests would get in.  Hmmph...  Frustrating and a ridiculous, considering those guest-lists were in circulation all night and some idea that they were over-booked should have been evident much much sooner.  But fine... that kind of thing happens too, I suppose...  By All Means Necessary... (Boogie Down Productions, 1988) At this point, KT, in her most tactful and professional demeanor (... and a vivaciously flattering top...), set out to see what could be done.  We were told to go ahead and just get in the guest-list line.  Then told we weren't on the guest-lists.  Then directed to speak with "that guy"... who told us to talk to "this guy"... who said to KT, "Sorry, there's nothing I can do, try another club".  Wow, really?  Stakes is High... (De La Soul, 1996) During the horrific menagerie outside, three friends, assured we would get in, threw down the $grand for table/bottle service and were awaiting our arrival inside.  Aghast that we were turned away, they negotiated for 7 of us (5 girls, 2 guys) to get in; the other half our crew had gotten in by just walking up to the counter as-if they were on the guest-lists (Bum Rush The Show... Public Enemy, 1987).  As it would turn out, another doorman would demand that we purchase another bottle @ $300 for the admission.  Hmmmm, really?  Your bottle service, as it were, allots 3 guests per bottle and there were only three people inside with three bottles.  Ludicrous.  Tougher Than Leather... (Run DMC, 1988) So, we walked away... no club is worth that much stress, drama, and runaround.  Yeah, I used to like Tao... USED TO. _______________________________________ BIG-UP BIG-UP BIG-UP!  Some of you guys were cool (clip-board guy with the faux-hawk and the Polynesian guys),for trying to do all you coulda/woulda for my girls/crew, thank you much anyway.
828	1	Someone told us (my boyfriend and I) to find the Secret Pizza joint at the Cosmopolitan, and that we would LOVE it. And, after 30 minutes of searching for this place, we feel in LOVE with this place! (the alcohol might have helped)   I encourage everyone to adventure/trek/ search for this place. And when you find the place, order the White Pie Pizza - it's to die for!! Yummy yummy in my tummy. We also suggested this "pizza place" to our friend's parents who are of Sicilian decent, and they stated that the white pie pizza reminds them of their family made pizza from Sicily.
569	1	I am a fan! I have heard about Bachi Burger forever and was happy to see it and when I drove by, made a U turn!  The way I judge a burger is by the flavor of the meat. I cannot eat gluten so I do not get to have the joy of a bun, so when a burger is seasoned well it is a pleasure for the palate. Bachi Burger does it oh so right that I did not miss the bun. I was in heaven. We both ordered the Kiki Burger, and I wish one would have tried a different one but I now have a reason to return! The meat,the carmelized onions, mushrooms and cheese was pure decadence. I give the server props for letting me know the sauce was not gluten free! That was a touch I truly appreciated. I also liked that there was extra lettuce to make up for the bun, it is a great touch because it is annoying to pay the same for getting less. It was just juicy and oh so good.  We shared the oxtail fries. They were very good and the portion is very large. In fact, half came home. The meat was tender, flavorful and a nice kick. It was too spicy for my Mom even without the jalapeos but I was happy to finish them off. Next time if I ordered the fried it could be with another side as it was too much food! I want to try the other fries as well, so I will be returning'  I hear it is busy all the time, so as far as service goes I suggest not going at peak service as it is not large, so one may have to wait for excellence.The concrete floors and high ceiling makes it a little noisy but that is also the urban vibe. We had one main server but several different servers and busses came by to make sure we were taken care of!  The is one of the best burgers I have ever had, 5 Stars!
24	0	Yeah this place is so unfriendly to guys its not even funny. Granted I was with my family so clubbing was more of an afterthought instead of the main event. We didn't have time to go look for passes or get on the guestlist. We get there around 11:30pm. Yeah yeah sorry for being a tourist first. We wait in line for 25 mins in the general admission line and its 20 bucks each.. Me and 3 girls equals 80 bucks WTF. I think tao doesn't know there's a recession or maybe doesn't care. I should have seen it when they walk 12 girls in and 2 mins later they all walk out. If I was with the guys I would have followed them instead going inside. What are they thinking, hot girls never want to pay cover. I did see some guy get in with the laced vans though.  when we get in its a huge cluster f#*k as usual. No room to dance or do anything. We go and head to the bar. 4 drinks were 67 bucks plus tips. At least the bartenders are fast and courteous. It doesn't matter because the marketing genius behind tao wants to shoot foam into the air everywhere, especially into your drink so you can go buy another. Forget about my $300 blazer.   Oh I wanna give a big F U to one of the bouncers. I had this glowstick with me from a concert I brought into the club. I started ravin' out for kicks. Some hot chick on the 'girls catwalk' sees me and asks for it. I ask the bouncer if I can give to her in person. He goes naw, I can't let you walk through the VIP tables... I give it to the bouncer and he walks it over. She blows me a kiss and walks down from the catwalk. I try to going through crowd to meet up but I never see her again. Thanks Mr. cockblocker, you made my night.
920	0	Nothing Serendipitous about this place. It was overpriced and the hostess had about as much charm as my sweaty feet from walking in Vegas in 100 degree weather. A bad attitude too. I should've saw the red flag but we needed to evade the "Hot Babes Direct to You" swaggers for a while.  We just had desserts (which were pretty standard) so I can't comment on the food but I won't be back to find out. Our waitress was nice but overall this place had a really crappy vibe. Thanks but no thanks.
1932	0	SLOT WINNINGS TO BUY BREAKFAST   On Thursday night, which was my final night at Vegas, I won $574 in a slot machine at Flamingo. I wasn't planning to have breakfast the following day when I checked out. However I decided to get breakfast for the following reasons: 1) I got a coupon for $5 off for breakfast as a Total Rewards Member 2) Instead of gambling I still can get points by eating here.  After the first plate I lost my appetite. Here's why. The first plate included scrambled eggs. I like my scrambled eggs wet but something was wrong with these eggs. They left a bad taste in my mouth and stomach. Gordon Ramsay said he could tell if a person can cook well if it knows how to cook scrambled eggs. Well someone should've vetted the person or people who cooked theses scrambled eggs. I ended only have three plates of dishes because of the scrambled eggs. The rest of the items were pretty good like ham, sausages, hash brown, and blue berry pancakes. But I always felt to determine how good a breakfast buffet is by how well cooked are the scrambled eggs.   My advice is if you won big money from the slot machine I suggest skip this place and treat yourself to a higher quality restaurant.

We just ordered the cheese fries appetizer and unfortunately the chili was way too much on the sweet side for both my husband and I.  Also it had way too much cheese on the fries to the point where other than the few pieces that hung off the sides of the plate, 95% of the fries turned out to be soggy.  I think this place is a bit over hyped now.  Oh well, just go for the desserts maybe.
1042	0	Im not going to lie this is one of the most expensive asian resturants ive been too. but it was something different from the fast food, americam and buffet we were having in vegas. i loved the design of the resturant! very different compared to lots of other asian resturant you'll go too. expect to put out about 18-22 dollars for each plate or so for a small portion. Food was served out fast but tasted okay! serving was great!
1264	1	Honestly what better way to combat a hangover in Vegas than a cheesy pizza loaded with meats and veggies...hot and ready to order? Yeah, nothing. This review wont be long I swear...because I want you guys to just find this place....on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan...exit out the elevator to your left...then quickly to your right...spot the hallway after the Jaleo Restaurant and make a right down the hallway..... and see the glorious yet tiny SECRET PIZZA place. It's everything your heart desires. Whatever you want, order it- This place is where dreams come true. I was craving a good pizza place, absent of the fancy Vegas pretentiousness and I found it. Made to order. Orgasmic. You gotta do it guys...
387	1	I came to this place with pretty high expectations. Let me tell you what... they did not disappoint!! Our server was extremely helpful and explained the menu thoroughly. I'm not going to explain the entire menu but we began with the Jalapeo Onion Pedals and Zucchini Fries. Man were they delicious. They sound like typical bar food, but these were done right. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Not too greasy and not a hint of sogginess.   I opted for the "build your own burger" option.  Chose the Angus Beef, sesame seed bun; topped with: smoked gouda, bacon, over easy egg, lettuce, tomato, onion, and of course TUFFLE MAYO. The truffle mayo was absolutely amazing and is a MUST when you check it out. It takes a special kind of mayo for me to dip my fries in there. I've never in my life dipped my fries in mayo... but I wiped that shit clean.   My girl got the same except Ciabatta bread and caramelized onions. Instead of the mayo she got the Chipotle Aioli. Also very good.   Lastly, I got the Vanilla Shake with Heath bar and Cookie Dough. The shake was really good as well. I'm not a big shake person and honesty I can't remember the last time I've had a shake... but this one was definitely memorable.
770	1	Waited 25 minutes to get seated here on a weekday night and had a pleasant experience. Though the seating was a bit cramped for a party of six, the food and service made up for it.  I ordered a rising sun burger which supposedly has kobe beef which is misleading. In America, wagyu is the equivalent of kobe. Despite that, the burger itself was quite good and larger than other gourmet burgers.   Service was also commendable. Our server was generous and accommodating but may have to work on her jokes.
908	1	Being that I stay at the Cosmo now (yes they won me over from Palazzo/Harrah's) I always make it a point to stop at this spot. Lunch or Dinner I think it beats all the high end restaraunts in the Cosmo...especially for the price. The Tapas joint has salty foods, the sushi joint is just ok, Comme Ca - I have yet to try. The cafe on the ground floor is good if you can beat the line.  Now DO NOT go here after the clubbing hours. Its madness, the pies get picked up almost immediately and it takes forever to get a couple slices because people just want something in there tummies to take the buzz off or kill the hangover that is going to come the next night.   GIven its next to Marquee - all the clubbers will hit this spot immediately after partying.  I have met the chef here, and he was real friendly as is most of the staff (Unless its post clubbing time - which is crunchtime for them)! I recommend the white cheese pizza and a simple Pepperoni. But if its late - good luck whatever comes out of the oven first is what you are going to get - but alas - the pies here are all good. I have tried 5 or 6 flavors and none have dissapointed me.   Here's a secret - if you are staying at the Cosmo you can order a whole Pizza and they will deliver it to your room. It takes about 45-1 hour but it beats waiting in line with the rest of the drunkies!
726	1	Nothing has changed..excellent service, excellent food..very pricey but it's all worth it.  This time I had the ceasar salad, filet (medium rare), Mac and cheese, foie gras, bone marrow and the sticky toffee pudding...my plate was empty when I left and my tummy was very happy
975	1	We knew that this trip, we needed to try Lotus.  We tried for dinner on a Thursday night and wait was 1.5 hours, reservations for dinner were booked a week out :( the host suggested we come back when they open at 11. Lunch is first come first serve. Flash forward to Friday morning, we show up about 11:05 and there were about 4 tables already sat and a steady stream of tables after us. I got the drunken noodle prawn off the chefs recommendation , the FI got a street vendor special that was on the northern specialty menu and we go the #14 appetizer that our waiter suggested.  No joke, best Thai food we've had. The originality the menu had, the last 4 pages...that's what you come here for. Slap yourself if you get Pad Thai.... Food has major flavor....like an explosion of spice and heat and layer upon layer of it. Oh man....yep. that good.
1778	0	For the love of God, if you see this place....run.  My girlfriend and I were unfortunate victims of this restaurant.  Having just flown into Vegas from New York that morning, maybe we were jetlagged.  Maybe the brightly lighted fish tanks allured us.   But alas, the fates took us here and it ruined our entire evening.  We were walking around Caesar's Palace and saw advertisements.  "A noodle bar?"  It sounded quirky and interesting enough, an honestly delightful complement to all the other restaurant reservations we had made for the rest of our trip.  So we strolled in, after quickly reading a few Yelp reviews.  They weren't positive.  We had figured that perhaps some people were too harsh, and the reviews were mixed.  Well, I should have figured something was up when the person with the most check-ins for this restaurant was our hostess.   And it began.  Taking a seat, I couldn't help notice that as opposed to the normal restaurant attire of Vegas, most of the other patrons were wearing t-shirts, shorts, and swim trunks.  At 7 pm at night.  I shrugged it off, and looked towards my girlfriend who was trying to piece together the atmosphere as it was her first time in Vegas.  We trucked on and ordered.  The food arrived 5 minutes later.  Never a good sign, I've learned.  The pork buns themselves were okay..but horribly overpriced.  Our noodle dish however, left us in such disbelief that we called over the waiter. As opposed to its 22 dollar price tag, we had gotten lo-mein made with spaghetti.  In sheer disbelief, we called over the waiter as we had felt like we were massively gutted.   We had gotten a noodle dish so terrible, I would have gladly preferred to go to the local mall, and gotten food court lo mein.    Because we're troopers, we finished the meal and reached for our check.  Still hungry, we noticed that the price tag of the meal was 50 dollars.   For a small dish of what was lo mein, badly cooked chicken, and pork buns that practically defined mediocre.  It may have ruined our evening, but don't let it ruin yours.  Please avoid this place, and find any other establishment.  ANY OTHER PLACE.  This is a waste of your time, money, and honestly, is a blackmark on a pretty great hotel.   But hey, at least they have pretty fish.
196	1	DEFINITELY WORTH THE DRIVE We found our way here by accident last year and made a point of going back this year. Everything is delicious that we have ordered. Pork carnitas skillet was perfection. Apple cinnamon pancakes were delicious as was the often-mentioned banana nut muffin. Come hungry or share...they are generous with their portions.
1968	0	Big Disappointment! If I can give it a ZERO, I would!  Paid $900 for the VIP Bottle Service.  We went in a group of 10.  We were treated so very well at beginning and at the end,they basically acted like they did not know who we were. They talked to us by name the entire time.  I was tossed out because I felt sick, went up stairs to the bathroom and threw up.  It was so hot and humid from the fully packed people.  People were literally dancing on each other on the dance floor.  I wonder if they even have a limit capacity.    Anyways, a bouncer escorted me up to the casino floor, told me that they had found my husband and that he would come out to meet me at the entrance.  15 minutes later, he never showed up.  Asked one of the bouncer by the door to see if he knew what was going on.  He said to ask the other guy which turned out to be the guy who took us to our VIP booth and accepted our credit card.  Asked him if he remembered who I was, he said yes.  I told him that the other bouncers told me my husband would meet me by the entrance.  Showed him, my "X" on my risk cause I couldn't go back in.  His face totally changed and acted like he did not who I was and said he has no way of helping me.  Really? He was the guy who took our card and escorted us.  My party was literally looking for me all the place.  They asked the clean ladies upstairs by the bathroom and they said they never saw me.  LIARS!     Trust me, they are just after your money.   Once you are done with the drinks from the bottle service, they are done with you.  No need to tip their waiters and waitresses.  They are so fast to clean your booth and bring in a new group. They brought new ppl to our booth while my party was still their.  Their VIP sucks so bad.  They put 2 parties in one both.  There's no separation between you and the other party.  If you request, they'll just have a bouncer to come in between.    Take your money elsewhere.  And for an actual real VIP booth, please go somewhere else unless you want to pay $$$$ and share with someone else.  We went to Encore the second night and had a blast their.    Love the Venetian, hate the CLUB!
335	1	It's my birthday, and the staff here really went above and beyond tonight to take care of us. I am so appreciative. It's rare, even among top restaurants, to feel like the staff truly care about your particular experience. Tonight I felt like I made new friends.   The rib cap was one of the best steaks I've ever had. The toffee pudding dessert is also now burned into my memory. It's amazing.   Special thanks to Tracy for such a great night.
1636	1	The best burgers in Las Vegas!   I lived in las vegas for three years before coming to burger bar and I wish I would have tried it much earlier. You are able to make your burger any way you want it, there are over 40 different toppings to choose from and you pick the meat, bun, and all the toppings you want.   I got the buffalo burger with caramelized onions cheese and bacon. It was amazing and cooked to perfection. A place that will actually cook a burger the way you want!   The sweet potato fries are great as well!   if you are on the strip or are just in the mood for a gourmet burger this is the place to go!
1785	0	Vary Poor customer Service from the front door to the Bartenders. The Worst of them Was the So Called Manager. they really all should take Customer Service 101 Training I Would Definitely Not Recommend Any One to Go There. Manager Should go Have His 200.00 Walmart Suit Pressed Out.
1083	1	Everything was EGGtastic. The long wait was worth it. All of the staff are super friendly and Alexa was awesome. She was very nice and attentive. I ordered the Chicken, Mushroom and Spinach and enjoyed it very much. My boyfriend for the must-haves stuffed French toast and he thought it was great. Make sure to check-in on Yelp to get the complimentary banana nut muffin.
934	1	Hidden in a dark hallway in the Cosmopolitan is a hidden jewel, Secret Pizza.  I was staying in the hotel and heard about it through a client.  I never would have found the place otherwise because it's not advertised in the hotel. Despite the lack of advertising the place was packed (a good sign). I'm a New Yorker and a bona fide pizza snob, so to say this place did not disappoint is a big deal.  Fresh, good and inexpensive which is saying a lot in notoriously overpriced Vegas.  Would definitely go back.
120	1	I went for lunch. I got a pesto scramble and I have to say this was one of the best flavor combinations I've had in a while. There were eggs, pesto, whole spinach leaves, cheese, and I think some tomatoes scrabbled to fluffy perfection.  My fianc got the western omelette and he said it was the best he's ever had.   We bought a groupon at $24 for $40 worth of food so it was a good deal too, but I am definitely coming back in the future.
1892	0	This place is alright. I've been wanting to try it just because it's Serendipity and I haven't been to any of the other ones. I didn't have time to wait in line and eat there so my friends just went for the window instead.  My boyfriend and I shared a Cappuchino Frozen Hot Chocolate and one of the dogs. I think it was the regular one. New York Dog? Not sure.   The dog was just that. Just a hot dog. Nothing special.   I hardly noticed any cappuchino flavor in the frozen hot chocolate. I expected it to be more fabulous.  The only thing that really caught my eye here was the fact that they give you Total Rewards points for buying here. And that its plastic utensils are so shiny that they look like real silverware! lol
103	1	If I could give 6 stars, i would.  I had heard about this place for over a year from co-workers who travel to Vegas regularly.  I get my share of Vegas as well but this place is about 6 miles away from the strip and I hear it's a pain to get a cab back.  So it's taken me nearly a year to try this place, but i'm glad i finally made it!  Enough storytelling, time for the good stuff.  Bachi Burger puts an Asian spin of the traditional burger and combines some of the things you love in Asian cooking into a sandwich.  Our goal was to try as many of the burgers as we could as there were three of us.  First, great beer selection here!  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries and it was a perfect side option for 3 people.  Comes with an egg on top.  The yolk mixed in with the chili and cheese is just the right amount of gooey goodness.  Again the goal was to try as many burgers as we can so we each decided to get something unique and promised to eat one half and split the other half into two so we can all get a taste of each other's.  This was a brilliant idea and I recommend you all try this if going as a group.  Burger # 1: Miyagi Burger - It's their signature burger and comes with grass fed kobe beef patty, some sort of amazing sauce, fried egg and onion strings.  Amazing texture and taste Burger # 2: Spicy Miso: Simple with an amazing spicy sauce that provides just the right amount of heat. This was my favorite! Burger # 3: Unagi Burger:  This one costs $24 but it's well worth the price.  It was a little too sweet and rich for my taste but def worth a try  So after all this we sat there.  Our stomachs were full but we still wanted to end with a bang. The debate was if we wanted dessert, and if so which ones.  Except I had another brilliant idea and recommended we get another burger and split it in three.  I think we were all thinking the same thing, I was brave enough to say it.  So we sat and wondered what else are we going to go with.  Our wonderful server recommended the Mr. Hong, since it was different than what we had already tried.  And what a great recommendation it was!    So like I said, in the beginning, I'd give this place 6 starts if I could.  Not only was the food great, our server made sure we were taken care of from the moment we walked in.  I'm making Bachi Burger my go to destination every time I visit Vegas.
1611	1	I went to Vegas in January.  I ate here the majority of the time.  These burgers were the shit, dude!  Very fresh, and well prepared. I don't quite remember what I got on most of the burger. Can you blame me? My family came to Vegas before this time, and said this place was awesome. They did not lie.
1149	1	We were here on Tuesday evening and were seated within 5 minutes for a party of 5.  We had the Korean Prime Kalbi, Prime Kalbi, Flat Iron Garlic, Beef Toro, Bulgogi, Salmon with Bacon, Enoki with Bacon, and Japche.  Everything was delicious and the meat was very tender.  My kids are picky and they ate almost everything, which was amazing.  Service was very attentive to us.  We will be back the next time we are in Vegas!
142	0	I wanted to love this restaurant..., I truly did because I heard Jose Andres was the Chef owner and as a DC resident I love anything Jose Andres!! One night my girl friends got take out after a long day of partying but her sister is a foodie so the fact she said her Seafood noodle dish didn't have lobster and it's $50 and then  said her food was  not  good, I became  worried because I was really excited about eating there. So Saturday after a long day at A Cedric Gervais pool party, hungover and starving we went to eat here and the food was not good at all. It was salty it tasted like MSG and I felt sick after my meal. I wouldn't be too excited to eat here again . Sooooo Disappointed :/
1876	0	They gave my friends and I the three worst rooms in Vegas.  One room had trash all over it. We waited over an hour for them to clean it!    The next morning, the kindest, sweetest person in the world got on the phone and complained like hell.  She got us moved into very good rooms.  If they had just given us the nice rooms to begin with, I would be writing a two star review.    But just knowing they would give someone the rooms we originally got is enough to get this hotel a one star review.    Overall the hotel was in poor condition, and I would never reccomend this hotel to anyone, except this one guy down the street I hate.
1923	0	Casino review only: Ya this is an old casino but I was in there a couple of days ago and they seem to have refurbished it some.  It was a good place to gamble and the staff was all friendly & helpful.  Food court was pretty good, great pizza, and pinball hall of fame annex is a nice distraction.  I liked the Riv for both it's history and the effort they're making to make it nicer.  Sadly in late 2012 & 13 my visits weren't so nice.  Drink service is non existent in casino and bars are understaffed with surly bartenders.  Riv is typical of a dying property and it's a shame, so much history here :-(
1281	0	Shrimp and crab salad: the shrimp was rubbery and not cleaned.  Mini mac & cheese: passable with a liberal dose of salt and pepper.   Dirty glasses and, with a nearly empty restaurant, it took too long to get it. The hawaiian ribeye that my husband ordered was fantastic, though, hence the two stars.
336	1	I had to add a star for getting to meet Gordon Ramsay. He was genuinely a nice guy. Had some drinks and split a burger at the bar, it was a fantastic burger. Tender and flavorful. The bar staff is as friendly as the rest of the staff that we have encountered.
354	0	Tried the veggie dog and got an order of cheese fries.  This is probably good for drunk people who just want throw crumpled up money on a table, point at a wall and then ingest whatever they were thrown.  This place is all about the name and nothing else. Everyone in line was using a Groupon and wish I knew that ahead of time. For two veg dogs, two orders of fries with cheese, it was around $20+ from what I recall. You can sub a veg dog into any of their menu items. But we opted to make our own with toppings.  The fries are salty and limp and when you add the taco-bell style face nacho cheese on-top, its just a gastrointestinal mess. The dogs are large in portion but were not hot (temp wise) as I'd expect for something that was 'just made'.  If your desperate for food, this might be an option, but by all means, its not the only option in this area.
179	1	Date/Time: Sunday ~ 8:30pm Occasion:  Bachelorette party dinner Party of:  Six Ordered:  Half dozen oyster appetizer, Steak Frites, Fromage dessert Location: Cutesy Italy-like look, open spacing, nice romantic lighting.   Total incl gratuity: ~$66 pp  I am impressed.  I didn't what to think initially but there was not one item that I, or any of the other girls, ordered that we were not pleased with.  The oysters we got were an assortment but by far the best oyster would have to be the Chelsea Washington oyster.  It as though I slurped up a piece of buttery goodness.  My mouth is watering thinking of it.  If I could go back in time, I would order a dozen more of those.  My flat iron steak came with a mountain of fries.  The meat, which was medium, was SO good considering it was a flat iron steak.  The girls tasted my steak and were in love.  The endless fries were crispy and a delicious compliment.  I had a bite of the pork chop, which was amazing.  Tender, succulent, juicy...the way pork should taste.  As always, any where that serves cheese will always get me so I ended my perfect meal by ordering the three cheeses for dessert: Valle d'Aspe (sheep's milk), Mt. Tam (cow's milk) and the Onetik Bleu (sheep's milk).  They were magnificent!  I thought the prices were incredibly reasonable, service was friendly, and the food was absolutely delightful.  Would I return?  Most certainly so.    Good choice!  Job well done, Thomas Keller! :)
1794	1	Like most reviews on here, I am gonna go out on a limb and argue that this is probably the BEST Thai restaurant in the US. I completely agree with all of you.   My girlfriend and I came here on our last trip as recommended by yelp, and wow am I glad we tried it. The area didn't exactly look promising, but once we saw the crowd inside, we knew something was up. We knew we were about to have an awesome meal.  Food - We started with the Nam Kao Tod, which is Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. The spiciness was perfect, although too much for my spice-sensitive gf, but she still enjoyed it enough to brave through it. Yum. 4 out of 5  Then we had the Tom Kha Gai as recommended by the waitress. This is when I knew I had to rave about this place on yelp. The taste was perfect. It was the taste that I would compare all tom kha/yum variations to. Noone else comes close. Seriously. 6 out of 5? lol  Of course, we had to try the Pad Thai. My girlfriend and I always judge the quality of a Thai restaurant based on their pad thai. Why? Because every Thai restaurant has it and it is probably the most popular Thai dish in the US, thus, every Thai restaurant should not only have it, but they better deliver in quality. They did not disappoint. This was the best Pad Thai I've ever had. another 6 out of 5.  Service - our waitress was a Thai lady. She practically recommended all of the dishes we ordered and even recommended which spices to use to bring out the flavor even more. Such a sweet lady =] she got a huge tip :P  Price - It's the price you'd expect to pay at a Thai restaurant.. ;) I'd gladly pay for each dish. Twice.  I need more stars for this place.
1325	0	Diablo must've sucked the soul outta the food, cuz it was so bland!  We came here for lunch and boy were we hungry! Usually when we go to hispanic restaurants, 2 plates is too much for the both of us, so we ordered a burrito to share and some chips n salsa. I'm used to chips and salsa being complimentary, but it wasn't here. I think we had to pay about 5 bucks for the chips and salsa. That's a lot considering it's usually free.  The chips came with 3 different salsas, none of which had any flavor. It was like eating chips dipped in water.  We were starving when we got here so we ordered one burrito for the both of us expecting it to be gargantuan like usual, but boy were we wrong! This burrito was so small! Probably the size of a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell. The only difference was that it had sauce on it. We looked at each other and said "wtf, we're still gonna be starving after this." So we tried to take our time eating that little hot pocket with minimal flavor. After a minute, we were done and I finished off the chips by dipping them into the beans it came with.   Diablo is deceiving, why should I be surprised?
936	0	I'm such an idiot. I didn't check Yelp before I went in. I'm Yelp elite for chrissakes - I check Yelp for everything.  If you're reading this, congratulations. You're making good use of this invaluable public resource. Now you can avoid my experience of spending like $150 on a dinner that was the equivalent of a Howard Johnson's.  How can anyone make pizza taste bad? And how can even the soft serve ice cream suck - how is that even possible??? Apparently, it is. Take my word for it.
1364	1	The best KBBQ in Vegas. Literally my first stop every time I visit Las Vegas.   The portion size is quite large for kbbq. You really get the most for your money here. The grill isn't sticky like other places I've been and it isn't smokey.   My favorite dish is the Korean galbi. It's not too salty and has a nice marbling of fat without being fatty. The combination of sweet meats with enoki mushrooms coupled with a sweet onion and perfectly steamed rice keeps me coming back time and time again.   When you've had enough of the overpriced food from the overhyped restaurants on the strip, hop over to gangnam for a great meal the whole family will enjoy at a price that will keep you at the poker table a little longer.
813	0	I wish I can give zero star if I can. The cashier & staffs were so rude, no willing to work there. The male manager who were working at when we were there, he wasn't willing to listen my complaint.   Here is the story.   I just came here at buffet and i spoke to one of their lady to ask how busy and what's their holiday pricing (usually pricing is different during the holiday). She seemed nice and she said 28.99 + tax. So I didn't buy the discount coupon from tix4tonight. And then I came here and they said pricing is 36.99. And they blamed me that I should remember the lady's name. Do you usually remember the person's name even if you want to ask the general question? Such Hours and pricing? If the manager knows how to treat customers, or manage his employees, they should give us the rate that she mentioned. I wasnt happy that he treated me and my family like this.
1135	0	Do NOT go here. The bartender told me the burgers are done just right with a little pink on the inside. Mine showed up charred on the outside and 100% RAW inside. At first they tried to play it off like it was supposed to be a little pink and didn't want to admit their mistake.   If you're in the mood for incredibly expensive burgers, I would recommend going elsewhere.
1142	0	Good thing we had Groupons for the food and drinks.  They were terribly overpriced.  Besides the pricing, our server was terrible.  She took our food order and then we never saw her again.  We waited 15 minutes after eating to pay.  We had to track down another server to bring us the bill.  She said she would have our server help us.  After waiting 10 minutes, we paid at the bar and left.  Terrible customer service for the outrageously priced items.
767	0	Hate to give it one star, but it truly deserves it.  I am accustomed to coming to Vegas and eating pretty decently, even on the cheap.  I was so sad that this place disappointed me so much especially being in Planet Hollywood.  First thing first, someone in our party tore a muscle in his leg the night before and was in a wheelchair.  The hostess asked him if he was drunk.  We were all so offended, he just wanted to eat.  Feed the man.  We come to the table and we aren't too sure who our server is because no one really introduced themselves.  First, a girl comes with water and spills all three waters, some of it landing on me.  Ice and lemons are all over the carpeted floor and they leave it there!  A gentleman takes our orders and comes back because he didn't write down our order and had to clarify.  I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and it was not a good idea.    Overall, bad experience and will not be back.
256	0	So my boyfriend was giving me a hard time for being a bratty princess with the need to stay at a fancy place. Ok, fine, I'll show you. I booked this hotel as a Christmas "gift" to him just to show I can stay in such "cheap" place.   And boy was this cheap, as in, cheap in every way. The room was mediocre at best. The floors had stains of god knows what and the bathroom arrangement was retarded. Only the shower and toilet was on tiled floor, the sink is outside in the carpeted area. It  was... stupid. The walls were ridiculously thin and you can hear EVERYTHING. My friend told us about his bad experience with LVH with the maids throwing away all of his stuff had me paranoid so we stuffed our belongings in drawers and closets as well as took pictures of them to make sure we have proof. Luckily nothing happened but I do not want to go through that ordeal of feeling unsafe.   My boyfriend said we're never staying here again. HA! Proved you wrong hunny and even you were appalled.   DON'T STAY HERE!
1011	1	Finally breakfast is something fun again.  Hash House A Go-Go has made breakfast hip and fun again.  The food is terrific.  Giant portions of flavorful, unique and delicious food.    It is a expensive...for breakfast, but not for the original food.    This place is much more than eggs and hash browns.  It is an experience.
1339	1	Wow what a hidden gem. Do yourself a favor and get off the strip for some really good food. Do not mistake this place for one of those cheap all you can eat Korean buffets. This place has set menus based on number of people or a la carte if you want to make your own combination. The must have appetizer is Uni and pork belly. It's low carb, fatty and creamy. All kinds of yummy goodness. Seriously. One order has two wraps so order accordingly.  The meat is such good quality. Trimmed and perfectly marbled. You can choose marinated or natural. I recommend natural since the quality of meat was excellent it doesn't need much. This is how you know the place is good when you grill the meat simply and dip it in a bit of sesame oil, salt and pepper.  This is now my new must go to place when I come to Vegas. One of the best Korean restaurants in Nevada and I highly recommend it.
1310	1	Here's another one of my Vegas favorites. A great place for a first date or taking friends from out of town. The ambiance here is simply one of a kind.   More neon, mirrors, and red velvet than you can shake a stick at! Oh and the video screens everywhere with cool 80's videos, those are great.   If you can, get a seat next to the water feature with flames ripping out of it, it's a little warm but pretty cool.   I've never actually eaten in the restaurant but the food in the lounge is pretty tasty. The selection is standard bar fare.   The cocktails are not the cheapest in town but they're pretty good, and delivered by sexy ladies. The super sized scorpion is good for a group.   Some of my best nights have ended here. Skip the other late night eateries and head straight for the Peppermill!
91	1	Once again, Hash House A Go Go is a must! I hit Hash House A Go Go on Friday for lunch. I got there a bit before noon and only had a 15 minute wait for lunch. My previous two visits were about the hash so this visit had to be about the Chicken and Waffles.   Wow, the plate, like all of their others, was huge! Two breasts with drummies and about two full waffles with the bacon cooked into the waffle. Making this to order took about 20+ minutes for it to get to the table and it was worth it. Gotta say the chicken was good, the waffle was good but as another review said - a little more syrup (okay, "Maple Syrup Reduction") would have made it a bit better.   I ate about 2/3 of the plate and gave up. I was so full I did not need to eat for the rest of the day.  This restaurant stays on my must-visit list for every time I go to Vegas.
1990	0	I have never experienced such rude mean service from the security staff. I was there for a bachelorette party this past weekend and holy sht it was beyond packed I'm surprised that the fire department didn't shut this place down. Thankfully we had reserved a table and purchased bottle service everything about the bottle service was fine up until all decided to go downstairs and dance, did I mention how crowded it was.  As we were walking downstairs I was pushed into one of guard the  A$$wipe takes me by the arm and slams me against the wall and starts pulling me thru this maze of a back room. After witnessing how they beat up on some guys I was horrified that they would do the same with me, eventually they asked the meat head that took me back there what i had done and the he said I had given him lip and pushed him, really??? it was an accident I didn't push you I said, after apologizing for something that I didn't do they let me return to the party. I got my stuff and LEFT I was not going to spend any more time there.  The next day I woke up with bruises on my arms and on my legs. I would not recommend this place to anyone it's not worth it this place is way too crowded. I was told that they also took the person who was walking behind me and that they punched him twice.  The only reason why I didn't call the cops was because I didn't want to be the one to ruin the party.
1431	1	Yo! I'm literally mid meal and had to stop to review this before I forget! Service is excellent. Our server (Lucas) brought us free Pizza flavored popcorn, was very nice and accommodating and made great meal suggestions. The food is delicious! The Rising Sun burger is like eating sushi with Kobe beef and the Turtle Cheesecake Milkshake is the best milkshake I've ever had! (You can get it with or without booze in it) Definitely worth a visit.
835	1	I've been here several times and everything here is always perfect. From the wait service to the quality of the food. The butter here is simply amazing.   I ordered the Boudin Blanc while my husband ordered the chicken and waffler. My goodness, that is the juicest, perfectly seasoned roast chicken I think I've ever had in my life!!. I totally wasn't expecting it and I found myself eating off my husband's dish. The boudin blanc is tasty as well since I've had it before, it's a good dish to get over and over.   This time i ordered a side of Lyonnaise potatoes. Potatoes were good, but with all the other food I was eating already, i barely finished that.   I'm definitely a fan of Bouchon since this is my must stop brunch place whenever I am in Vegas. Next time I really want to try the beignets!!
907	1	We ALWAYS take our visiting friends here, without fail. Asian fusion burgers never tasted better. I love their taro bun burger as well as the banh mi burger. My husband's go-to order is kiki's burger. Since we've started going there about a year ago, they've added a multitude of appetizers and desserts, probably due to the hours extension and additional bar. For the exotic beers they offer, I can see the draw in that. My family and I, however, have only eaten their for lunch or dinner.   We've never had bad service. Beware of wait times, though!
1542	0	Two weeks ago I headed to TAO nightclub with a girlfriend and our boyfriends. Bringing the guys was our first mistake. We went because 50 Cent was hosting the evening. That was our second mistake.  Even with guestlist, free passes and wrist bands, we still waited a solid TWO hours to enter the club. The bouncers told us, point blank, that if we hadn't brought our boyfriends, we'd be in the door right away. 'Nuff said.  50 Cent arrived around 1 a.m. and, after a quick photo-op, I'm quite certain he went through the club, out the back door and left. He wasn't seen again for the rest of the night.   By the time we got in, it was packed shoulder-to-shoulder, the bars were impossible to access and room to dance did not exist. Needless to say, I was only more than happy to get out of there. Without purchasing bottle service, you can forget sitting down anywhere.  To be fair, I'm sure TAO would be great on any other night. The decor is stunning, the dancers are beautiful, the venue is spacious and the music was fantastic. However, next time we're in Vegas, there are a lot of other nightclubs I'd be more inclined to check-out before I give TAO another shot.
671	1	When my boyfriend told me he wanted to eat a $60 burger, I thought he had lost his mind. Who would pay that much for a burger? Well, after having it, we would, that's who.   This burger is decadent. So decadent, that I would suggest splitting it. We sat at the bar. Ordered a beer on tap, ordered a side of fries and the $60 burger split.   The place was casual, fun and we genuinely had a good time eating that burger and hanging out at this restaurant.   If your in LV, then your probably thinking your going to spend some money anyway. If you like meat, and your not opposed to spending your money on a really expensive burger, I say this is a must try.   Enjoy!
677	0	This place is in DESPERATE need of a major makeover. No extra blankets or pillows in the room. The bathroom 'looks' clean but with all the years of grime built up seems dirty. I won't take a bath in the tub because it needs a major scrubbing or to be replaced. Even the shower curtains are dated.  Only enough shampoo for one wash and NO bar soap.  Lamp shades have holes in them. TV is dated, even the programming is from the 80's and 90's.  Hallways are pretty quiet in the evening.  Room service is another area that's needs a major improvement. I ordered one pancake one egg and two milks for $23.80. It was brought to me in a bag in two 'to go' containers. No salt, pepper, or any other condiments, and food was ice cold by the time I got it which was less than 30 minutes from ordering. The room also lacks a table to eat a meal at while looking at the view of the roof.  The guy who brought it up was sketchy and almost wouldn't bring it in the room.  If I wasn't here on business and someone else paying for the room, I would move to another hotel.  All in all this place is a dump.
1235	1	What a great place! Came here last night with a group of 8. The waitress split our bill for us didn't seem too thrilled about it but dealt with it. I ordered the Bulgogi burger and it was probably the best burger ive ever had. Juicy, spicy, sweet delicious. Had a fried egg and kimchee on it. Weird but definitely worth it. Also an order of onion rings. Although pricy when they came out there was a huge plate of them and they were perfectly crisp and totally yummy.  Others had plain burgers, salad, Philly cheese steak spring rolls. Everyone left happy and full. Oh, did I mention milkshakes?
1793	1	Best burger experience ive ever had so far in vegas!  When we got there me and my bf had already perused the menu all week deciding what we wanted to order so I was thrilled that the food lived up to my stupidly high expectations.   I ordered the burger sliders as an attempt to test my taste buds to see if I could tell the difference between the different kinds of meat. Long story short...I couldnt. But it was still nice to get a variety of toppings on each one so that you dont get bored. The best thing though for me was stealing some of my bfs truffle mayo (which like all the condiments/sauces comes on the side) and putting it on each of my sliders. It was sooooo goood. Now im a sucker for anything with truffle so thumbs up for that. One thing they should do is let you order some of their toppings even if you are not making your own burger. Next time I think id want to try the truffle sauce.   Bfs burger was kobe with foie grais and some other stuff. He said he couldnt really taste the quality of the kobe either. The kicker was the foie grais which they give a generous amount of. Next time he said he would just order the angus meat as long as he had the foie grais.   Even as we were leaving and throughout that weekend I could not stop thinking about those little burgerw with truffle mayo. Burger bar I will be back!
1335	0	We stayed here for two nights (Saturday and Sunday). When we arrived, there was a 15 minute wait to check-in. They then informed us check-in time wasn't until 4pm but that we could upgrade to an immediately available room for $25/night. We declined. Our room was a 'non-smoking/Mountain View room'. The Mountain View was way off in the distance and only visible above the ugly rooftop of the casino. When the sun went down, they were kind enough to point bright red lights at the hotel windows. The air quality/air filtration in this hotel is horrendous. Despite being in a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor, it was as if someone was sitting on our bed chain smoking. When we shared this with them at check-out, they were confused. I will never stay here again, which is unfortunately, because we'll be needing a place to stay this Friday.
324	0	Don't waste your time!!!  I was in a good looking group and skipped the line just to spend the next hour in a line to the over crowded mosh pit( No room to dance at all), then a pushy line to Tao Beach...no dancing....then back in a pushy line back to the over crowded main level, then to a 40 min line to get out!    We almost reserved a table...so glad we didn't!  The crowd often pushed right into the people at the tables.  There is nothing exclusive at all about Tao.  They obviously pay the celebs to come.  I gave it 1 star vs no stars because the staff was kind of nice and the girls in the bathtubs were hot.
889	1	I love it. The charbroiled prawns were amazing, even with mouth on fire from the chilis (we got the spicy ones). Definitely order some of the northern Thai dishes the place is known for.  The only thing we got that was just average was the Drunken Noodles - I've had better elsewhere.  But even they were devoured by the end of the meal.  I will make this a must-eat on Vegas trips!
331	1	Last week, I had the choice of any reasonable place in Las Vegas for my graduation lunch. Having only had the lunch buffet before at Lotus of Siam, I decided to atone for my past errors in judgment.  I had an opportunity to read the articles all over the waiting area in the twenty minutes or so of wait time, so I learned that Lotus of Siam has been open since around 2000. Amazing. I'll bet the plaza in which they're located was also pretty rundown back then, but the quality of their food has probably not lessened and their reputation has only soared. I did my research this time and, along with some appetizer suggestions from my mom, we picked a lot of specialties and Northern Thai menu options.  The food arrived all at once after perhaps fifteen minutes. Patience is a virtue, as we were rewarded with delicious food. For starters, the tod mun plar (#7, $8.95) was a great take on a deceptively simple fish cakes with nice pickled cucumber. The nam kao tod (#14, $7.95), everybody's favorite crispy rice dish, was definitely yummy but a little too sour for my taste. Also very delicious but not suited for my palate was the yum nuah (#36A, $12.95), which is a great beef salad that's just too spicy for me and paralyzed me in fire and sweat for a few minutes. The spicy catfish with basil leaves (#85, $14.95) was a solid if small portion of sauteed fish in a basil sauce  After recovering from the yum nuah, I delved into the Northern specialties. The khao soi (#A, $9.95) was one of my favorite tastes of the meal. To call it an egg noodle curry is not nearly doing it justice, so I'll just say that you'd better order it when you get the chance. The kha nom jean nam ngyow (#G, $9.95) is a non-spicy pork and rice vermicelli dish that reminds me slightly of a certain Vietnamese dish called bun rieu, but I wouldn't have this one again as it seemed a bit boring compared to some other dishes. The last item from this part of the menu was the nam prik ong (#I, $10.95), a non-spicy dish consisting of a red chili paste and various items to dip into it. Pretty nice, possibly worthy of a repeat, but not a palate dazzler either.  I think the best item we had may have been the garlic prawns (on the chef's choice menu, $22.95). They are certainly pricey, and they are actually kinda worth it. Very crunchy, perfectly cooked, and just delicious. And even considering the modest portions of other dishes, definitely a splurge.  Having finally had items from the proper menu, I can now confidently express my opinion that Lotus of Siam deserves all of its praise. I don't know if I'd tell somebody to fly here just for one restaurant, but when you are in Las Vegas, you must make this a destination. Oh, and you'll definitely want to reserve well in advance if you choose dinner hours. Just saying.
1049	0	We got a Voucher to the buffet, decided to use it for breakfast thinking that people can't really screw up breakfast...and I was wrong! The donut holes were dry, orange juice luke warm, are the scrambled eggs real? The only good part of the breakfast was the bacon. Thank goodness it was all paid for by a voucher.
111	0	Not impressed. Evening dinner before a show on 1 Oct 16.  Very poor start with reservations running behind.  When we were seated 10 minutes behind our time there were plenty of seats available. Some tables had things others did not even the basics like salt and pepper.  I looked over the salad bar while waiting on the server and it was not worth the effort. We ordered the drinks and the meal immediately since we had the time to read the menu ahead and the drinks showed up 5 minutes behind the meal. (15 minutes). the meal was prepared well but the serving size to cost was poor (almost twice what I would pay elsewhere for a filet mignon). Our server was slow on checking on drink refills and even slower handling the check. They were using a tablet system to order (supposedly for the first night) and finalize the checks but watching him the receipt printers were a challenge.  The restaurant itself looked satisfactory as far as decor but the bathroom was undersized for a restaurant of that style where people are going to stay and eat a while for their money.  I am certain we could find a better place on the strip.
455	0	I've heard good things about this place, besides for the long lines of course, so I thought I would give it a try. My BF was there earlier and waited in line so I was lucky I didn't have to wait that long. We came on a Friday night around 6 and the place was super packed already. It took us about 15 minutes before we were actually seated. Dinner was $11.30 Monday-Friday and $12 over the weekend. Drinks are an additional $2.  As for the food...they have a... Salad bar:  Salad bar was okay. Nothing special about it. You can create your own salad with any topping you could think of or they have a pre-made ceaser salad. They also had 2 different types of soup that day, chicken noodle and chili. They also had your typical potato salad/mac salad/ and stuff like that so nothing really stood out about their salad bar.  Mexican/American/Italian/Asian food: they had a variety of different types of food, but none of them were too my liking. I'm not a picky eater. I'll try everything once, but the food was just...boring to me. They had your typical orange chicken, kung pao something, quesadilla, onion rings, pasta, fried chicken, pizza, fried shrimp, and more.  Grill area: around the grill area they had toast, fried/popcorn shrimp, stuffing and of course the steak. My BF got a steak on his first plate and it was cooked just how he wanted (medium rare) and it wasn't dry at all. He liked it so he got another one and that one came out super dry that he couldn't finish it. But the steak in my opinion wasn't that good. It didn't have any flavor on it at all.  Desserts: they had pies, cakes, the chocolate fountain, cotton candy, and ice cream. None of those things really stood out to me either. I had to get a marshmallow covered in chocolate though, but the strawberries were so tiny and didn't look appetizing at all. Ice cream of course is always good and I've never seen a buffet with rainbow sherbet so that made me happy. And take the cotton candy before you leave!  Service: It was good actually. Better than most buffets I've gone to. Plates were taken away pretty quickly and drinks were refilled when we barely drank half of the cup. Seeing how crowded the place was, I was pretty surprise with the service.
815	0	Everything in this whole hotel has to do with tits. The room had giant cleavage 'art' on the walls. The casino is full of hookers and men in Hawaiian t shirts. The pool is a hole in the ground full of dirty water. and.. I was not surprised when I noticed the giant cum stain on the couch cushion. If you are a dirty old man then this is the place or you!!!!!
729	1	My niece loves Gordon Ramsay, so out of the 3 restaurant choices we went here. Friendly greeting at the door, manager came over and took us to a seat after a very short delay - great service!! I will state this right now - best service I've had in Vegas in a very long time. We even got the wrong fries, and the waiter came over and whisked them off the table saying "those aren't sweet potato fries". Fresh SP fries on the table within 3 mins.  I had the Bleu BurgR - very tasty. My niece went another direction with fresh jalapenos and sundried tomatoes and she enjoyed it. Very tasty for $14.  Nice selection of beers as well, a little light on cocktails. I know nothing about wines but they have some, and I saw quite a few tables enjoying theirs.   Overall, great service, good food. Probably 4.5 stars because the burgers took a long time to come out.
1559	0	Extraordinarily disappointing. Burger patty was dry and overdone, but bacon was cold and cheese not melted somehow. Fries were underdone, with cold dry potato in the middle of the wedge. The $7 milkshake will not be getting any praise from Vincent Vega. At $35/person, it's steakhouse prices in highchair googie decor. Service was friendly, but slow, though they were good about refilling water. The brioche was very tasty; I wish the burger lived up to it.
1433	0	Came here late night with my best friend and her co worker! It was literally not the first choice of dining but at 3:30-4 AM there isn't much of a choice in Mandalay Bay. The menu of course is going to be expensive because it's a hotel chain restaurant/deli or whatever. The down fall is that with it being so late they have a very selective menu to choose from so you don't really have many options! Our waiter was an airhead and we had to keep asking him for the necessary things that should've already came automatically such as napkins and water.. After spending over $60 for some basic ass meal I was completely over it because there's no way no breakfast burrito that small should've costed $13 and then the potatoes were basic with no seasoning.. My bf liked the food probably only because he was drunk but other than that I can't see myself eating here again unless I had a food and beverage credit from the hotel, but wait even then idk I would probably choose somewhere else...
1007	0	I've been coming to this buffet before it was even called Flavors... Basically it's like an international buffet but the variety within each country is limited. The quality reminded me of hometown buffet, but it gets the job done of getting you full.  Came here during breakfast not really hungry. Stuffing yourself in sin city, what they hey? seems appropriate. There was nothing that I didn't try at this place. If you dined with me before at a buffet, you'd know I eat a lot (like there's no tomorrow). They had an omelet bar which seemed like a hit due to the line, but I'm against the whole waiting in line in a buffet while food is all around you.  I can point out many flaws of this place. Service sucked coming from a deaf server who worked as slow as a Windows 98 computer, prime rib was as chewy as the Trident gum I had in my pocket, scrambled eggs had a cake texture that you had to cut through, breakfast sausages had a casing stronger than my iPhone's, crab legs were puny, sushi tasted and looked like two colored lego pieces.   Couple of goods were the bacon, crisp, unburnt with a great porky taste. Broccoli were steamed to the right texture. The sashimi got me going back for more. I had a good 2 or 3 platefuls of these suckers. The best thing you can creatively make at this place is tuna w/ 'broccoli rice' wrapped in bacon "sushi". I also got bored with flavors from eating everything separately so I made prime rib tacos, mock sausage bacon and egg biscuits from McDonalds, vanilla tart using vanilla syrup and a heart waffle, and a sashimi sandwich with a dinner roll.   For about 25 bucks a head, you'll get full off of "ehh" quality food, but it gives you a reason to be playful as well because you won't feel so bad from eating plates of bland food.   P.S. - save room for dessert and don't eat here! They skimp on the sugar, oil, butter or something that has to deal with sweets' flavor. There's a Ghirardelli shop a couple steps from the buffet that'll oversatisfy your taste buds for sure.
1879	0	I don't get how this place gets good reviews. It's like one of the cheapest (quality and taste wise) buffet that i had in vegas. Total was $60 sth for 2 for that quality of food? It's not comparable to any other hotel buffets for that same price.   The quality of the food is just bleh. Everything from decor to presentation to taste is just very whatever. My usual favorite part of the buffet - dessert section just completely turned me down. C'mon..soft served ice cream??? (not even comparable to souplantations soft served). It's more like hometown buffet quality but hometown is 3 times less the price.   Ahh. Despite the desserts, other food was just not to my taste. It's true that there are a little bit of everything, from american to italian, asian, middleeastern, mexican, etc, but nothing was really that good. Probably the best thing that i had was a piece of prime rib that i got when we first sat down. When i went to get another piece later on, they already got a new chunk of meat, and that second piece was complete RAW, dripping blood.   I've been eager to try this place because i think this is one of the few buffets that i haven't tried in vegas and with pretty good reviews. Not a good decision. I will probably never go back again unless it's free.
1390	0	Eek! Methinks not is RIGHT.  I wanted to come here to see what all the hype was about. Sorry East Coast, White Castle did nothing to me. It did not wow me. It did not make me go crazy. I just felt like poop afterwards.  It was so expensive (maybe because it's located directly in the middle of the strip), for what it really is. A little slider.... with a weird piece of looking meat. And you can tell they're already made just sitting there, waiting for someone to pack it once you order it. It wasn't great nor was it horrible, it was just blah. And no one told me but they put ONE pickle in it.  I know it's a classic, but it ain't for me. Sorry fans. I'd rather spend my money at In-n-Out.
201	1	From the owners of Cheesecake Factory this place is delicious. I'm a gym rat and I was surprised to see many healthy options. Even offering a side salad instead of fries at no extra charge. I ate there twice at my stay at the palazzo. For lunch I had the grilled chicken avocado sandwich which was very good and for breakfast the fried chicken and waffles tickled my fancy.  Everything was presented and prepared very well. Service was good and prices are average for what you would pay on the strip. Large portions too! I will be back.
314	1	My husband and I absolutely love bachi burger! We have made it a tradition for the last three years to make this a mandatory stop on our way back home to SoCal from a Vegas trip. We have only been to this location and every time we have the best experience. The customer service is great and the food is top quality! We always put in at LEAST 2 orders of the pork belly steamed buns (bao). Yesterday, I tried the black garlic Tonkostu ramen. They have a separate ramen menu. Anyways, the ramen was amazing of course. We always leave happy and full whenever we come here. It's always a special treat that we look forward to.   Check out the article my husband wrote on this amazing food establishment: http://www.gravegoodssociety.com/blog/sin-city-pleasure-bachi-burger-shoku-ramen
648	0	Good food. Horrible service. Hostesses never once gave us a smile or seemed happy to have us. Server took almost ten minutes to greet us. Drinks took another ten minutes. Table sat down next to us and got up and left because the server never came and greeted them! As we were eating, someone from a table behind us threw up right next to our table. This was at dinner! There was no monitoring of people's alcohol intake and honestly, I lost my appetite after someone vomiting right next to my nachos. Overpriced, especially for the service. I live here in Vegas and was taking some friends out from out of town. Definitely will not be returning. I got a water refill once, and we waited for our checks with empty plates for 20 minutes. Stay away from this place! So many better options.
1777	0	Left without being served, waited over ten minutes and no one came to take our order.  Two ladies with children sat in booth behind us and we're served immediately....could it be because we were an older Asian couple that we were totally ignored???? I
713	1	Had an excellent breakfast here on May 6, but definitely could not finish it! The grilled mash potatoes were outrageous and the corned beef hash had huge pieces of corn beef in it.  I really liked the industrial feel to the decor, very cute.  Service was excellent too.  We had  a bit of a wait, but only about 20 minutes and it was worth it! Excellent quality and taste!
1419	0	This place is not very good.You get a 2for1 if you stay at TI which is all that it's worth, if that.  The food is cold and the only "fresh" thing I could see was the pasta made in front of you with choices of sauces/pasta.And the poor staff are not happy.Our guy never cracked a smile even when we try to make a little small talk.At least we didn't have to walk far to be disappointed.Oh wait, they did have fresh fruit (kinda sorta) so that was good if you like melons and pineapple.
1712	0	Tao is one of the most beautiful and spacious clubs I have ever been in. Seriously, it is like the best feast for your eyes. In every way this could be a place out of a movie. The cool and trendy Asian fusion inspired place where a major scene occurs.   But the thing is, you can't enjoy it at all. The line outside is insane, there must have been 1000 people in line when we got there at 11:30pm. Then we managed to cut the line due to the "finesse" of some guys we met in the casino. As soon as you get in, you are literally shoulder to shoulder with someone. I guess I'm lucky to be decently tall for an Asian girl, otherwise I might have suffocated in shoulders. Not only that, they totally skimp on the air cond. I mean seriously, Vegas is HOT, the only reason to go clubbing in Vegas, vs the normal home town is that you expect the eye candy to be better and to finally by graced by the presence of being cooled from the heat. But it was cooler outside the club in the middle of summer that is how hot it was. It was so dark and crowded I couldn't make out any candy. Then the dance floor was packed, literally the only thing one could try to do to dance is jump up and down.   Lame. The one thing was that the drinks were ok, but drinks can pretty much be ok anywhere you go. I would totally pass on Tao, if it weren't so pretty inside and the music wasn't decent, which it was, I would have given it one star.
1406	1	The pizza was delicious. The price , however was chocking, 5 bucks for a slice. After 2 huge slices I was still hungry.  It is better if you get a whole pizza for 25 bucks and is enough for 2 or 3 people, it is huge. The place feels like you are walking into a restroom, but the pizza's good. They make lots of $$$$$$
1269	0	Yesterday stopped by for quick light dinner.  Ordered turkey sandwich with  avocado, tomato, and greens.  Also ordered kale salad that include goat cheese and grains mixed in.  Sandwich was dry hard and salty so it was hard to consume.  The salad was hard and flavorless.  Sad...paid $49 for these food and didn't really the food.
1779	1	First off, I'm a huge fan of Hubert Keller's TV show and had to visit Las Vegas to dine at his restaurants. Although his other restaurant Fleur (located in the same building downstairs) was somewhat disappointing, the Burger Bar served the best burgers I have ever eaten. I ordered the Hubert Keller burger the first time, and it was delicious. The sweet caramelized onion sauce that came with it was perfect, and the medium rare buffalo patty was cooked to retain the optimal moistness. My dad let me try a bite of his American Classic, also medium rare, and it tasted even better than my burger! I loved this restaurant so much I came here for lunch again days later. Unfortunately, I did not have as great of an experience. I ordered the American Classic, and also I still call for it to be medium rare, it was much dryer than before. I asked for grilled onions instead of raw onions, but they still gave me raw. I called sweet potato fries both times, but they were less crunchy the second time. The service also felt less attentive than it had during the preceding visit. With that said, the Burger Bar still remains my favorite burger place, and I would definitely return on my next visit to Las Vegas.
1865	0	Food over priced & mediocre, especially the rattle snake/cactus appetizer for $17.95, deep fried & mostly all cactus.  Potatoes are ala carte. Kids screaming so loud, little to no conversation possible, and about the poor bull stuck in a pen, if they are not exercising him, I hope animal rights takes notice!
890	1	My 300th review, and what best celebrates that then with a review for the best darned breakfast/lunch joint in TOWN! I'm from San Francisco, and I wanted to eat somewhere OFF the strip. (I was staying at Vdara). So I yelped Egg and I, and ventured off the strip with my rental car and my husband. My husband of course was a bit hesitant to venture off the strip, but he was SO happy I found Egg and I. (We ate here every morning of our 3 day stay). It was seriously that good.  We ordered- breakfast burrito (ordered with egg whites and light cheese) A+ chicken fried steak: A (better to get sauce on side IMO) chicken omelet (it had a "special" name to it) A+ Denver omelet (ordered with egg whites and light cheese) A+ whole wheat pancakes (HUGE ORDER!) A+ Portions are big, so don't order too much!  Service was great! We had the same server all 3 days. She was surprised to see us back on the 2nd day, but was just laughing when she saw us the 3rd day. A bit funny I know :) She made sure our visit was pleasant, asking if we needing anything. The only thing I needed was help walking out their door, since I ate so much.   I hope Egg and I continues to serve great food. Sadly we don't live in Vegas, so we can only visit when we need to sunbathe and gamble :) So that's twice a year, hopefully more!  Thanks Egg & I, for a 5 STAR experience.
193	1	i have been coming here for the last 8 years or so.  i first heard of LOS in a gourmet magazine article and had to try what the craze among all the food critics was all about.  from the first time i ate there till the um-teenth time, it never disappoints.  i always stop by for lunch when i'm in las vegas.  i've enjoyed almost everything i've tried here...don't forget to try some of the northern thai items...the northern style larb and pork stew is especially good.  then finish the meal off with coconut ice cream and the coconut sticky rice with fresh mangos.  N.B. if you go for lunch, do not get the buffet.  you've been warned ;-)
1479	1	Amazingly awesome service, food quality, food quantity, and prices!  The hash was fantastic and fresh made.  The pumpkin flapjacks was not to sweet but just right.  It didn't even need the butter or syrup.  And the sage chicken benedict was off the charts!  The chipotle sauce had a nice heat to it.  Just perfect with the mashed potatoes, chicken, spinach, tomato, biscuit, and egg.  Excellent!
425	1	You have not tasted an amazing burger until you have tried Gordon Ramsey. Absolutely nobody should compare this restaurant to bachi, because it is beyond amazing.  My friend and I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and only waited for about 5-10 minutes, which was fine because it gave us time to peruse the menu and check out yelp for some tips.  I decided to try the brittania. The mango chutney made me a little hesitant, but I decided to just go for it and I'm glad I did. The mango, arugula, and sharp cheddar worked in a beautiful medley with the beef. It has this amazing sweet and savory was amazing.  My friend go the euro burger. She really loved it. I tried some of it, but it made me realize that I really don't like goat cheese.   The truffle fries were pretty great. It was actually really big. I shared with my friend and we couldn't finish it with our burgers. The sauce it came with was amazing. The truffle aioli was something else. Y'all need to hit it up!  I forsure can't wait to come here again and try the hog burger, if I'm not really tempted by the Brittania again. It was that good.
206	0	I went here with 9 other people for Memorial Day weekend.  I've been to the NY one which I absolutely loved and was really excited to know that there's a Serendipity much closer to me now.  First thing I noticed was that they have a window by the side of the building from which you can order to go.  I found it really interesting and convenient that they did that.  Although there were long lines, they seemed to be moving rather quickly.  I have to say though, I was really disappointed by my experience with the Vegas Serendipity.  Their service sucks.  When I went to get a table, they told me the wait would be about an hour.  That's understandable and fine.  After 50 minutes of waiting, my friend suggested that we check to see how far along we were.  We go up to the bitchy hostess and she informed us that they had called us.  But our beeper never rang!  And we were waiting right outside their door the whole time.  Another server then explained to us that some of their beepers were broken and said that they'd clear a table for us immediately.  Which was nice except the extra little comment she had to add which was "You guys are lucky we'll clear a table for you now".  My friend and I just looked at each other astonished.  WTF?!  The beeper issue is not our problem, it's the restaurant's.  They shouldn't be so cheap and use beepers that are broken.  Still, we didn't let that damper our mood.  We went on our merry ways and ordered a load of food.  (Their menu, compared to the NY branch, is not as long and may differ a bit)  I shared an omelette with a friend and ordered the Forbidden Broadway Sundae for myself.    The omelette was plain but decent.  Nothing worth talking about.  The sweet potatoe fries that came with it were really good but not so much after you take it home as leftovers.  When our waiter was taking down our orders, he had made it a point to ask me whether I had wanted my dessert after or with my entree to which I replied after since I didn't want to the ice cream to melt.  For some reason, my dessert was brought out with my entree.  When I told the guy that brought it out, he proceeded to give me attitude and told me "Well it's already here.  If I were to bring it back, it'll take another 20 minutes.  But I mean... I could bring it back if you really want."  I told him it was ok and he just rushed off.  No apology, no empathy, nothing.  Whatever.  I had a great dessert piled with whip cream that I had asked to be left out.  Oh well.  What could I have done at that point?  Overall, it wasn't worth it.  The food for the most part is mediocre (my friend told me the One-Eyed Jack was bad and that the bread was so hard it was inedible) and the prices are high.  If you want to go just to say you went, then go.  Otherwise, avoid it.  There are a bunch of great buffets (Wynn!) you can hit up in Vegas.
1889	1	Went with some friends who were visiting and I was really excited to try this place. It was definitely a vegas bucket list for me. The space is hidden on the 10th floor of the Venetian and it's kind of hard to find. The restaurant I think is a beautiful open space with a classic French design. The menu isn't too expansive. It's small and the way it's organized can be a little confusing.   We started off with mimosas, escargot, froie grois pate, and the small seafood platter as appetizers. They also served is complimentary bread with the most delicious butter and blackberry jam combination. I loved the escargots . It can with a puff pastry on top to soak up the garlicky oil goodness. I even dipped extra bread in that sauce. The texture of the escargot and flavor was on point. The froie was good but it's was really hard. Like a spoon can stand upright in it. I definitely like the taste of a actual froie filet better but texture of this was good. I give it 3/5 stars.   The seafood platter was a beauty. We couldn't stop snapping pics of it. The lobster is flavored and it was delicious. The texture was a little chewy. The shrimp was also plump and fresh but it would have been "crispier" if you know what I mean. The oysters were delicious!  Both kinds were. Sweet and fresh. Loved them. The mussels were ok. Could have passed on that.  We didn't get our mimosas until after the appetizers and the waitress felt so bad she gave it to us on the house. That was such a sweet gesture. I love it when restaurants comp things for you when service isn't just right.   For main dishes we got the croquet Madame, the salmon plate, the burger and the steak hash which was the special. The croque Madame is so rich and buttery and gluttonous. I don't think I can eat all of that but my friends did. We also upgraded to truffle fries and that was an excellent idea since it was delicious and the biggest hit. I liked my salmon plate. Nothing special and it's something you can make at home though. The steak hash wasn't that great actually. For 30 bucks it tasted like the steak hash I can get at a diner.   Overall it was a great experience and the service was wonderful. Somethings in the menu are superb, some are just good ( standard but not worth the price) and yes guys this place is pricey.
1566	1	Hands down the best pizza in the country. I was in New York just days before I came here and would say without a doubt better pizza than there. It's slightly hidden hence the name and absolutely packed late nights but well worth the line. A must try if you're in Vegas!! It looks like a little hole in the wall but seriously just try it and you're life will be changed.
1043	0	I stayed in the Mediterranean Tower on a Thursday until Sunday at The Riveria. There wasn't a refrigerator in our room, the room didn't come stocked with all of the essentials for travel, the TV service in the room is lacking (HDTV with no HD and lousy low def lodgenet service), and we had two rooms we had booked to be next to each other, but they were not able to make this happen. However, the casino is very nice and the staff is very friendly, and there's a nice pool and a tattoo shop along with other shops. Just take note that the Mediterranean Tower is inexpensive, so expect to be a bit underwhelmed. The one thing that made my 3 star rating a 2 star was the unavailability of WiFi, which is crucial for someone like me. The WiFi was working great on our first night's visit, but then the WiFi network dropped off early the next day on my and my friend's devices, and I was unable to log on with my laptop computer. Certainly the hotel can provide better coverage, especially for someone who might have to remotely connect into work in the case of an urgent matter, and it would have also been nice to play music on too. Of course I was in an inexpensive part of the hotel, but I wouldn't stay at a hotel that didn't have reliable WiFi. I called the front desk to complain and they thanked me for reporting it, but unfortunately we were unable to get back on the WiFi network in my and my friend's room, and we were a good distance apart. I hate to say it, but I don't think I would stay at this hotel unless I was given a free night's stay in a better room with WiFi that will continue to work. Here's hoping they give me a chance to formulate a second opinion. ;-)
54	0	This is a review of the restaurant inside.  Like so many others, my experience here consisted of questionable food and an unfriendly waiter, who didn't trouble himself to stop by our table even once to ask us if we wanted another beverage or anything else. He sure had time though to stand around looking bored, talking to his buddy near the back where I watched him do absolutely nothing for 20 minutes. So I decided to just walk up to the bar to get my own drink where I was met, eventually, by an ill-tempered gal who did nothing more than raise her eyebrows when I asked for a beverage. The chicken was overdone on the outside, underdone on the inside- shrimp like rubber. Straight up- this place is bad, stay away.
1699	0	Poor quality.  We both ordered yaki udon, one beef one chicken.  We are meat lovers and neither of us ate the meat.  The beef was gristly and the chicken wasn't fresh.  The noodles were mushy.  The hot sake was harsh!  Disappointing for the money.  Waiter was mediocre.  Wouldn't go back.
479	0	Service was terrible, the meat service took awhile before they come to your table. I didn't see the waiter until I had been sitting there at least 10 minutes. Water took another 5 minutes to show up. For a $50 price tab I feel robbed. They wouldn't even accept the $5 off from the yelp app.  I'll never go to this pretend Brazilian steakhouse again.
237	0	My best friend from high schools little sister turned 21 recently so we all headed to vegas to some fun.  They all booked rooms here based on the pool, so I went on hotwire and booked a room for my boyfriend and myself.  While hotwire is all about not telling you what the hotel is they give you a map and its pretty easy to tell which hotel you will be in.  So that was all pretty easy.  I called them and specifically asked for a smoke free room with a king bed.  That was all pretty easy and nice.  Our room was in the West Wing, which is pretty reviled on yelp and I understand why.  While nothing was super bad about our stay, some things made it not a place I would pay to stay in again: -the valet, there are like 5 entrances to the MGM by car, but only one of them takes you to the valet. WTF -the west wing hallways are seriously dark and kinda skeevy looking -no mini fridges in the room -horrible cable, they have like 7 channels and 5 of them not in english -security came and scolded my friend for leaving the door to her room open while we were in it -the rooms have absolutely no sound proofing at all. you can hear everything in the hallway and in the rooms next to you.   -$15 a day for wifi.   -no robes -i tried to move the side table closer to the bed and it was super sticky, since we had just gotten there, that was pretty gross  MGM is supposed to be nice, but they obviously put all the people who purchase rooms on the internet in lame rooms with absolutely no amenities.  If I were to ever stay here again I would have to make sure it would not be in one of these rooms.
947	0	Enjoy the feeling of being packed like a can of sardines?  Have enough free time to wait in lines even after getting in?  Feel like bumping shoulders, elbows, while on the dance floor?  Like short bouncers with a Napolean complex?  Great!  This is the place for you then!  Pay an extravagant cover fee for the experience!  Thank goodness I didn't wait in the hour+ line and got in right away through hookups, otherwise it would've made the experience all the worst.
1977	1	My girlfriend and I had planned a trip to Las Vegas about 6 months ago and Bouchon had been on our list of places to eat since we are a bit on the "foodie" side and really wanted to try a Thomas Keller restaurant. We made reservations for our first night in Vegas which happened to be a Monday evening.   I received a confirmation call earlier in the day which I appreciate. We arrived around twenty minutes early for our 9pm reservation hoping to get a drink at the bar first. Upon arrival, they told us our table would be ready shortly and pointed us to the bar.   The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was as I had suspected it to be. Music playing but not too loud and the decor fit well with the french feel but not too old feeling. The bartenders were quick in getting us a cocktail menu and we were served within minutes of sitting down. The cost of drinks was no more than any other high class restaurant and were delicious. My Bulleit Manhattan was delicious and made perfectly. At 9 o'clock exactly, our table was ready and we were seated.   Our waiter was very nice from the get go and always attentive. He offered up a few suggestions as well. We ended up having a bottle of wine which the sommelier brought to our table. Being big duck fans, we ordered the Confit de Canard which was crispy duck leg with soft yellow polenta, hen-of-the-wood mushrooms & a red wine duck jus. The duck was prepared to perfection and the polenta and mushrooms added some various textures to it with the duck jus giving it a nice bite. We were very pleased.  For our meals, my girlfriend ordered the Gnocci which will melt on your fork if you don't get it in your mouth quick enough and I mean that in a great way. It was probably the best Gnocci I've had. Not too soft and not too hard and the brown butter sauce was simple yet delicious. I decided to mix it up and get chicken which I rarely ever do. It was the waiters suggestion as they are well known for their Poulet Rti. It was worth mixing it up as I thoroughly enjoyed the dish.   Being on vacation, we wanted to try as much as we could so we made sure to save room for dessert. We tried the Profiteroles which while being pretty basic, still hit the spot. I have to give extra points to them as well because they have a Cigar To Go menu with the desserts. Prices weren't too bad either considering what you would pay elsewhere on the strip.  Overall it was a great meal. Service was good. Not exactly memorable but got the job done and had no issues. Food was spectacular if you are looking for a good fine dining cuisine. Ambiance and atmosphere was classy and fun and perfect for Vegas fine dining.  I recommend it and cant wait to try another Thomas Keller restaurant soon.
1900	1	This dinner was a great experience all around.  Our server, Dennis, was top notch and made great recommendations.  Be ready to spend some money (especially if you get a featured app and wine) but the beef wellington for 2 for $100 was well worth it.  It actually brought tears to my eyes it was so unbelievably good!  We had the small seafood tower for an app, split the wellington and truffle mac & cheese and toffee pudding for dessert.  This restaurant is one of the main reasons I will go back to Vegas.
512	0	The lines around dinner and lunch time are always colossal, almost equally so to some of the people standing in them.  I was impressed by the variety of food available here when I managed to finally get in. I guess my choosiness allowed me to luck out and grab the best parts of the meatloaf and pot roast. However, even considering this, the foods seem to contain very high levels of salt. I had four glasses of water by the time I was done with my meal.  The service isn't bad for such a prodigiously crowded eatery but I won't be coming back until I hear about their food improving.  But, hey, at least it's cheap. It's dirt cheap compared to many restaurants in the area, although you can't expect too much.
177	0	I came here for lunch the day after my 21st and don't remember it being as spectacular as others have described. I do remember the line stretching out to Circus Circus and the variety of food being underwhelming. Definitely beats Hometown Buffet but for $20+ at lunchtime, they aren't the greatest deal on the strip, either. The quality of food seemed a notch above some others on the strip but it is definitely a bit overpriced considering the lack of variety. I would rather eat at Pharaoh's Pheast.
58	0	Came in with a party of 12 under a reservation. It took 50 minutes to place our order for food, after an hour seated we finally got our drink order. If you want a burger, one could literally butcher a cow, grind the beef, and cook it yourself faster than the "service" at this restaurant. One could probably drill a well for water faster than they brought it to the table, as well.
1255	1	LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Thomas Keller, you are amazing. This is a MUST try brunch place in Vegas; I will take this quality food over 3+ hours of waiting for a buffet anyday. And this being my second Thomas Keller experience, and just as good as the first (Fleur de Lys, San Francisco), I am determined to try every Thomas Keller restaurant possible in my lifetime.  We had a 10-15 minute wait on a Saturday morning Christmas, but it was nice because we lounged around and looked at their menu beforehand. We did have a service problem. But I still gave them 5 stars for the way they remedied it. They brought out one of our orders before the other... WAY before. I think we waited a good 15 minutes for our present order to get cold before the other one came out. However, like all top-notch French restaurants, impeccable service rendered the mistake to practically nothing. The service:  - waiter apologized many times - brought out assorted fruit plated in a cup by the chef - offered us drinks from the bar on the house - the restaurant manager herself brought out the dish and apologized - the dish was put on the house, cutting our bill in half  Service, service, service. They are AHHHMAZING, polite, speedy, attentive, and friendly. Except for that period of time where our waiter was a bit MIA, everything else was flawless.  I was a bit skeptical about their chicken and waffle, because... chicken and waffles? Thomas Keller? Most popular item on the menu? ...uhh, come again?  I was very happily proven wrong when we ordered it anyways. Chicken is usually too dry and waffles are usually too sweet. This chicken... I don't think I've tasted chicken so flavorful WITHOUT the gravy or waffles so flawlessly textured and flavored... add some of their gravy to your chicken, and some butter and syrup to your waffles... I could die eating this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day for the next year.  I got the crab special... I forgot what it was called, but it was a weekend special of crab, macaroni, and cheese, baked and topped with scrambled eggs and black truffle hollandaise sauce (black truffle anything, HOLLA!). I ate every bite even when I was stuffed up to my esophagus because it was that good.  Get their orange juice, by the way. Super fresh and a perfect balance of flavor to your meal. Judging by the flavor of the orange juice, I'd assume their mimosas to be great as well.  Ambience was wonderful. This restaurant is located near the Venetian hotel check in. You take a separate elevator up to a different, more secluded lobby by the pool, and the decor inside the restaurant is classic and has windows that look out to scenery.  Great service, nice ambience, and AMAZING food... I will most definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas.  Psst... check out Bouchon Bakery downstairs after your brunch and take something to go. You won't regret it!
1666	0	Wooooow! Where do I begin?  My cousins and I were looking for a great spot to grab a drink before heading to the airport to go home. We head to the bar and the most unfriendliest steroid filled bartender comes over to us and doesn't even greet us. He just stands there until I actually speak first and request a Michelada. He doesn't even acknowledge my 2 cousins and he walks away to another bar to bring me a beer in one cup and a salt rimmed cup with bloody Mary mix in a separate cup.... "the salt gets crazy that's why I didn't put the beer in it".... what the whaaaaaaat? I ask for a michelada and you bring me a build a bear workshop? Get outta here. I can go on but I'm so annoyed at his service. We left right away. Never going back. Only giving it 1 star because I have to. If you're having a bad day, call in sick.  Don't bring your attitude to the bar. Jerk.
323	0	Not a fan of buffets but people I was with wanted to go. Breakfast buffet $18.99 Friday morning, $21.99 on Saturday. I piled a plate but it still isn't worth those prices. I recommend you turn yourself around and go have a freshly made breakfast at the Backstage Deli tucked in a corner of the casino floor at Luxor, near the ticket area for Criss Angel's Believe. Way cheaper, tastier, made to order, and more enjoyable.  The More buffet is 2 sided. Both sides are not quite the same. If you are still going to get the buffet, I highly recommend you head straight to the Omelet station and have the chef make you a fresh omelet because the eggs on the buffet are watery and tasteless. Then you have Brown 'n Serve sausage and bacon. Cheese blintz with blueberry sauce, apple pie filling crepes, biscuits, southern white gravy, home fries, grits, mini pancakes, french toast, corned beef hash. I tried a little of everything the first day. Much of it seems frozen/packaged/heat & serve.  Day 2 I went right to the highlights: Omelet, corned beef hash was REALLY good, add some country gravy on top, lots of bacon, and if you try something sweet go ahead and dump a ladle of the blueberry sauce on it.  Fresh fruit, salads, and mediteranean dips on the center aisle.  On weekends they use 1 side for a few more lunch style hot dishes to make it "brunch" plus chilled shrimp, muscles, crawfish and 2 types of sushi, one was plain cucumber, the other looked like California Roll. Go ahead and skip all that nonsense. Unless your plan is to just take an empty plate up to the chilled shrimp display and go hog wild on it. Then maybe its worth those prices....nah. Still isn't.
982	0	Very unhappy with this buffet. They claim the "Best buffet in America". WOW, I certainly hope not.  Seafood spectacular was anything but.  4 items do make a spectacular, two of which were fried shrimp.  Up side: for $12 the food was tolerable.  DOWN SIDE: place was filthy. Food everywhere on floor, ground into the carpet - we were there for just over an hour and NO ONE cleaned the carpet even once.  Were they busy? Thursday about 6 pm, Steady business. Is this acceptable? NO. Having been in the business for over 25 yrs.- including  a busy buffet, I find this completly unacceptable. On the food line, at least 1/2 the items were empty the several times I walked the line.  All the cooks did seem to be enjoying  themselves rather than tending  to the line. The server was overwhelmed  by 28-4 tops that she was attempting to attend to by herself.  Staff training seemed to be non-existent as the busboy, when he finally showed up, seemed to have had no training at all. So: food - **; Service: Jenny- ****; Cleanliness - 0*.  I, personally will go hungry before considering this as a place to eat.
1446	1	Really accessible from the strip, perhaps a 10 minute ride. Busy during lunch times so remember to come early! Format is very similar to gyukaku except the grill is the Korean BBQ grill.   Ordered the Gangnam set for 4 when there were five of us girls - more than enough food! Came with miso soup, sweet corn, oysters, shishito peppers, mushroom medley, bibimbaps, and a crap ton of meat!!! Everything was really tasty, definitely a good cure for a long weekend out in Vegas!  Service is also awesome :)!
420	1	First time here a little of a wait but who doesn't wait in lines in Vegas? It was worth it. I wish for the double vs. the single since I was really hungry. Their fires were amazing cut fries they were crispy and had no grease at all and the taste was spot on! The service was also exceptional! The salted creamy caramel shake was a hit. Thanks for building a shake shack in LV. A must eat. Great for the entire family.
1584	1	Great food with super huge portions.  It was actually a lot more food than expected for a really good price.  We also had drinks and got to keep the crazy looking glasses. Only down side is, it was packed on Sunday around brunch time, with a 45 minute wait.  We were able to sit an order food from the bar right away though. A great vegas experience.
1317	0	Thirty bucks for steak and crab legs. Kinda pricey and easily overpriced. I will not be back. I'd rather go to Luxor and Excalibur all day for 15 bucks more. I'm glad this was a business trip and was expensed. Here's the breakdown of why: -The "steak" was rediculously overdone, which I can see why they would drown it in sauce. -The Roast Beef at the carving station looked more like a ball of muscle that they literally just lopped off of a cow. "Yeah hey, lets not trim that, it looks fine... I mean sure it looks like the meatball alien thing from Duke Nukem, but people love nostalgia. -The macaroni and cheese was creamy, but only tasted like macaroni. Why would you serve this? -The Crab legs... are sliced through with, what I would assume was, a table saw. Nothing screams delicious like small bits of crab leg shell in the steamed-out, dried up, blade-o-grass thin, crab legs. After I had essentially given up on the "great eating" here, I decided to try the lower quality "food". Who the hell makes sweet and sour chicken with chicken nuggets? Oh these guys do. And the nuggets? The only thing they were missing was a Double Bubble Branding. I didn't want to delve into why whys and hows, because it wasn't going to be pretty, but here it is. I hope that MGM can rise from this mess and actually produce decent food again soon.
1792	0	I'm sorry.. But I just don't get this place.   I didn't like the menu... I didn't like the food.... I didn't like the service... Didn't like the fact that I waited over an hour to be seated..... Didn't like the price... Their drinks are small and... well, just bad.... Didn't like the club/ restaurant thing going... Even their air con pissed me off... lol......   Yes, the decor here is amazing and inspiring blah blah.....   *urgh*
798	1	I loved this place. There was a 45 minute wait, but well worth it. I ate the pork stew off the northern menu. It was delicious. The place was busy, clean and the staff were very attentive. No surprise some of my favorite food network chefs had their pictures on the wall. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas
1365	0	I'm a buffet nut and have been to enough buffets to know when an establishment is a ripoff. I wish somebody wrote about this. Maybe people have different standards or they don't know any better and actually consider this buffet good. This place is terrible, especially for $87 -- 2 adults, 1 child, Monday night, an hour wait. Poor selection. Food doesn't taste good at all. Lots of plates empty and not being refilled. Do not eat here!!
1326	0	HERE'S MY IDEA OF A PERFECT NIGHTCLUB.  1. A huge dance floor. When you really wanna get down, you gotta be able to move freely without having to worry about getting an elbow to your chest or face.  2. Bar. You also gotta make sure the bar itself is pretty big and the area around it should have ample space as well.  3. Easy acces. Why the hell would you have to go up  a set of stairs just to have to make it to the main dance hall? You got female club goers all dolled up in their stilettos complaining that their feet hurt just making the journey from their car, waiting in line, and then stairs to deal with. The worst time is when its time to go. You got blisters already just from dancing (that is if you had any kind of room whatsoever), AND if you are drunk, you can easily be on youtube the next day.  4. Have plenty of bathrooms. It's bad enough you have to wait to get in to the club, but you have to wait in line to go take a leak as well? Yes when you drink alcohol it gives you an awesome feeling. Only problem is, it goes right through your system. So alleviating that should be convenient and not time consumming.  Music, DJ's, bouncers, and bartenders should always be givens. From what I saw these were very good.  Overall, I would rather go to a club that was not as popular cuz at least you can walk around somewhat freely and have enough room on the dance floor to be able to do "The Dougie" or the  "Gangnam Style" dance. Im pretty sure some fire codes were violated based on the zombie like overcrowding. Im surprised there are not more fights and/or lawsuits resulting from pushing, shoving, and groping.   So if I had a couple million in my back pocket, I would build my own club and call it "The Warehouse". LOL.
790	0	Very crowded (you couldn't really dance or get around)  Music sucked it would have slight pauses and weird mixture of music. Drinks where watered down. Saw a lot of people having issues getting out of there ( too drunk to go down the stairs) Oh and it was super hot in there!!  It was nasty.

YUCK.. Worst $23 spent ever and horrible service! Why did it take 30 minutes to get our food? 2 items? No cooking needed, just scooping the soup up... the congee was so bland.. drinking water was better that that.. and the duck soup..The noodles weren't even cooked all the way!  It was still all stuck together.. Waste of time and money.. and it was so hard to track down our server, let alone trying to pay our bill... Wish we just walked out..

The bacon and goat cheese and the tomato tied the whole thing together. This is one of the best burgers that I have had. I enjoyed every bite and would of ate (2). My wife had the Machete. I took a bite and tasted: spiciness, crunch and freshness. It's evident that the burgers here are well balanced with a fantastic flavor profile. All in all, the food, decor and service was an experience that my wife and I enjoyed. If you are in Vegas, do yourself a favor and check this place out, you will not regret it.
803	0	I had previously stayed at this hotel when it was the Las Vegas Hilton... at that time they were going through a renovation and apparently also changing the name... This was like 3-5 years ago.. Sadly, since then nothing has changed.  The one thing I remember that I did not like were the long long lines and wait times for the elevator.  There are two problems, there are not enough elevators and also they are not dedicated to lets say for example 1-20 floor and then another set of elevators for 30-40 floors.  When checking in, I opted to upgrade the room for $20... and was amazed that they called it 'an upgraded room'.  According to travelocity, this is a 4 star hotel... this room was more like a 2 star, so I can just imagine what the regular room looked like.  The room itself, the tub spout was coming off of the wall, it was leaking water and the tub didn't have a light... The ac/heater thermostat was not digital... and the door key/knob stopped reading cards... I was hard pressed to find any renovations to this room.
109	0	Upon exiting, I look for the Riviera Casino and Hotel. It appears that our GPS is guiding us to the slums. Moments, we are driving to a very old section of Las Vegas. I don't mind that classic feel, but when it's no longer maintained and businesses appear to be gone as well, it's quite depressing.  Arrival to the Riviera... .... ....  I've driven over 4 hours to arrive to a line with at least 50 people, so I'm sorta expecting a fun and entertaining counter to get my mood swinging UP! Check-in counter employees do not appear happy or mad, but they are quite depressing to deal with. They seem to be sick of their job.   I will never reserve a room here again. It is bad. My non-smoking room smelled so bad, I felt healthier breathing in the casino floor and/or hallways! The AC couldn't be adjusted to be comfortable, so it was either blistering cold A/C or hot HEAT. The unit didn't seem to be drawing fresh air either. The standard room's bathroom is small, and I couldn't hang my towels because the hanging mounts were all broken. The toilet barely flushes. The sink water has strong pressure, at least. The 1950's had it very well, but they can no longer compete with casinos on the strip. I would book Circus Circus before giving this place another shot.  I should have snapped a picture of the air filter (they actually have one!!) located inside our room. Last I checked, filters are meant to be replaced, not in continuous service while the white filter media is BLACK!!!!!!!!!  Why did I book this? It was the cheapest rate at the time (still above $120). However, it is off the strip, very depressing, and just not a place to dwell. The casino floors, however, was active and appears OK. They had one (1) Pai Gow table on a Saturday (9th) November, and people playing that night (8PM to 4AM Sunday) all received a FAT 5-ACES bonus for betting on the ENVY. 4 players received $1,000, and the 5-ACES hand landed on the Dragon Hand.  You would not believe the PIT BOSSES faces. They made us feel that we didn't deserve to win. They scrutinized the dealer at the time of win, and came back to ask more questions 3 hours later (after shift rotation)! Unfortunately, they weren't expecting to payout that much on a single Pai Gow table and it was clear that they were hurting that night.   At the cashier, I was asked "where did you win all this money"? I mean they were all on high alert since the table payout was $4,000 in bonus payout, and many bonuses throughout the period.  I will never stay here again, but  I would play at their casino floor, hoping for another good bonus flop!
1170	1	So glad I don't have to fly to New York just for shake shack. Although I love my In-N-Out, I have to admit that Shake Shake wins the West Coast vs East Coast rivalry. Shake Shack is now my favorite fast food restaurant. The Shack Stack is a complete mouthgasm. The double double from In-N-Out has the better sauce, but the giant fried portobello mushroom with cheese from the Shack Stack is unbeatable. The fries here are crinkled-cut, usually not my favorite, but they're actually well seasoned and crispy. I definitely prefer them over Animal style fries. I need to come back and try their milkshakes.
212	0	Landed at Hooters by way of www.hotwire.com, selecting a 3 star hotel in the South Las Vegas strip area.  I don't know the exact definition of 3 stars, but what we got was essentially a rundown Motel 6 with very poor service.  The hallways smelled bad, and the carpet throughout was dingy and stained.  Decor is cheap and the building looks very old.  At the restaurant, we got fooled by a breakfast buffet on the menu that magically becomes a "champagne brunch" on weekends for $3 more.  Management was minimally concerned when we took issue with the surprise on our bill.  Most of the offerings were stale and hard to bite into.  The bar by the pool carded my wife for a diet coke, which she was forced to return to the pool chair for.  I understand the concept of getting what you pay for, but I wouldn't have paid even $50 a night for this experience.  I will never return - it made the trip a disappointment.
209	0	This Westin has slipped. We always stay there for Furniture Market because the parking is free and very abundant. It also has the Heavenly beds which I love and a Starbucks in the lobby. Yeah! But something has changed and service has slipped. I'm not sure we will stay there again despite the fact that we are Starwood preferred members.   My room had very spotty air conditioning which was important since it was 107 degrees. So I called down to get someone to come fix it...yada yada yada...he comes...says he's fixed it. Temp doesn't change. Finally fall asleep exhausted from the day...hot and sweaty in the not-so-heavenly bed. Then the next day their solution is to move me....I don't want to move all my unpacked stuff to another floor from my colleagues one day away from leaving. She sends guy again. This time he discovers that he's left a critical part off the air co causing the air not to flow. Then it works wonderfully. Other issues...floor not swept or vaccuumed any day we were there. Trash left out in room....not "subject to interpretation" trash but things like crumpled paper and little creamer carton from the very very weak starbucks in room coffee.   Anyways....nothing was tragic...life is too short to get too worked up...but it does seem that there has been a dramatic shift since in the past it has been such a nice experience.
754	0	04/19/12 DINNER.  What misery. And sadness.  After nearly 1.5 years of living in Las Vegas, this has to be one of the WORST meals we've ever had here.  We used to go to the Pink's in LA a bit, as we lived in LA for a LONG time up until our move to Vegas in Dec 2010.   So we expected SOME quality.   Boy were we wrong.   And even with a $15 coupon, it was WAY too expensive. RIDICULOUSLY expensive.  Never again.  I had a polish/pastrami "classic" thing, SUPPOSEDLY with swiss. (Swiss air?) Spouse had a "baja" dog, or some such (he was like "HOW did they remove ALL flavor from jalapenos?") and some polish thing. All were just awful.  The fries were way too salty. Virtually inedible.  Very sad, that we can't get the Pink's of yesteryear. (Then again, we've heard sad rumors about the original, too, but we can't vouch, as we haven't been in so long.)  So avoid this joint, if you know better!  PS And you know what the WORST thing about this is? This franchise of Pink's is run by Block 16 Hospitality, the same people that brought to LV the following restaurants: Holstein's, LBS Burgers, Barrymore, Public House. I've been to 3 out of 4 of those, and have been from "quite pleased" to downright "in awe". So this failure in their portfolio should be jettisoned IMMEDIATELY!
834	0	My bf & I decided to attend this club because they offered the cheapest cover charge... bad mistake. We arrived fairly early, probably around 10:30 PM and there was already a line. Luckily for us, we were on the guest list and got in pretty quickly. The entrance to the club was weird. We had to go up a few flights of stairs (& this is a hard task for me since I was wearing heels!). When we got to the dance floor, it was pretty open and we had plenty of space. I swear, once 11:30 PM rolled around, it became SO packed. My bf & I could hardly dance. The majority of the time was spent outside. There were a couple of times I needed to use the restroom but once I saw that the ladies had to go UP another flight of stairs PLUS the wait of the line, I decided that my bladder will have to suffer a little.   The DJ played great dancing music & the crowd was live; however, I think I could've enjoyed myself at a different club where it was LESS packed and I could actually dance. The drink prices were ridiculously high but I guess I can't really complain about that since we were in Vegas.
1893	0	This place gets 2.5 stars.  I went to the original one in NYC and I remember it being more whimsical and better back then. My group of friends wanted to go really badly, and at the end of the day, I ended up going with 3 guys-- all of whom were super stoked to go. Unfortunately it was a disappointing experience for everyone.   ATMOSPHERE Same decor as the one in NYC but not as cramped. The music made it less cute (they were blasting hip hop) and service sucked.  There weren't any tables available so we sat at the bar. Bad idea... (explanation below)  FOOD We came here for the FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE, which was way more magical in our heads. Most people got their own, but my boyfriend and I decided to share because I knew how big the portions were. It's honestly enough for 2 people to share and the bartender even asked my 2 guy friends if they were going to share one, haha.  The frozen hot chocolate was good, but it wasn't anything special. What totally broke our spirits was seeing them make it. Since we sat at the bar, we discovered that the coveted HC was POWDER MIXED WITH ICE... it pretty much shattered our hopes and dreams, making the experience way less enjoyable.  Overall, this place is TOO overrated and overpriced. There are better places to blow your money in Vegas!
449	1	This is our first time visiting the restaurant and we absolutely love it! We ordered the Premium package and ordered an extra plate of beef tongue and pork belly to go with it. The menu is easy to read and has pitcures for you to see what each item is (good for first timers). The food presentation was very nice and fresh.   The staff is very welcoming and polite. They were prompt with getting our food out. We loved that they didnt hover over us. They gave us space and let us cook the meat at our own pace (unlike other korean restaurants where they just dump all the meat on the grill and start cooking anything and everything for you whether you're ready for it or not).   The restaurant also has a nice and clean dining atmosphere. We came here around 2pm on Friday and not many people we eating here. We will probably come here every time we visit Vegas (we are from TX).   We recommend anyone who loves korean bbq to come out and try this place when you're in Las Vegas! You will not be disappointed :)
552	0	We stopped in for a quick dessert and cup of coffee and it was anything but quick. The staff was not very friendly and the wait was simply unacceptable. 20 minutes for a piece of mediocre chocolate cake. I am willing to wait in a long line and pay extra for good service and great food, but not this. Don't waste your time and money!
115	1	I'm not all that crazy about spending $13-$20 on a burger, however, with that said, this place had a pretty darn good burger.  I got the buffalo burger and it was awesome.  I'd still rather go to the Apple Pan in Los Angeles, but this place is definitely up there. I was especially happy with the hostess.  There was a 40 minute wait when we got there.  We didn't want to wait so our party sat and ordered at a few open seats the bar had.  We saw a few tables open up about 10 minutes later and no one sat at those tables.  I asked the hostess if we could sit there and she initially told me that if we had already ordered at the bar we had to stay and eat there..house rules.  She then went to talk to her manager and in a few minutes we were in a booth.  what more can I say than...Niiiiiice!
456	0	I have been to brazilian steakhouses before and as their salad bar didnt have too many options. I wasn't disappointed. The men who bring around the meat were polite and did a great job! Me and my boyfriend received a free dinner voucher with them and ended up, upgrading to experience the flipper card dinner. At the end, the waiter brought us our check (we waited longer it felt for the check then it did for us to eat our meal) he explained with the voucher how mich our meal wouldve been and how much it was (free +  our upgrade) and how much we should tip based off howuch the check would have been. Ok great. We had our xash together as we had waited awhile to pay. Instead of letting him walk away, my boyfriend put the cash into the check thing and the waiter opened it up, counted our money and explained we did not tip enough based off his calculations. Excuse me, but we did leave a decent tip and no maybe wasnt based off a 100 check but, we didnt come there expecting to pay or tip on that. We were completely embarrassed as the waiter got loud in counting our money amd telling us it wasnt enough.. the tables next to us could hear and were staring. Forst of all, we were there for 20/30 minutes. Our waiter brought us water and we had a go with the meat one time. I didnt feel good leaving there and in all honesty if we couldve stiffed his ass, we wouldve. That is NOT how you treat a customer no matter how much their bill was. Shame on you guys! If you dont like the vouchers than i suggest you opt out of being apart of it. And his snooty ass can finally make better tips! How dare he!!! My boyfriend ended up tipping beyond even the pro rated calculations against my idea of leaving him even less for the sheer embarrassment he brought to us during dinner on our vacation. So i hope you spent it well!!
1505	1	We came for lunch and we are very impressed! The prime kalbi was amazing. Two of us has bibimbap and the size was bigger than we expected, and very delicious. It had plenty of crispy rice. One had the spicy tofu soup, and it had just the right amount of spice and the tofu was perfectly cooked. I liked that we could order meals and things to bbq. There were many options and we will definitely be eating here again. The staff was polite and attentive and very helpful.
1518	0	DISGUSTING!!!!   That's all I can say. I was dying for some Pinks in LA and happened to run into this location. I ordered the chili dog and the Chicago and hoped it tasted the same. Boy was I wrong!  The sausage did not taste the same as the ones in LA. I ended up feeling sick after eating it.   Listen to the reviews folks so you don't end up like me with a bad stomach ache.
87	0	Ok. When you go to Las Vegas to get the hell away and have to pay for airfare as well. All I can tell you is it's old, worn, but CLEAN! I did feel as if I was stuck in circa 1978 for a few days but hey! It actually worked for the money. It's not fancy and far away from the new part of the strip so I suggest instead of paying for monorail tickets bring or rent a car!
1124	1	Went there for my wife's birthday celebration and enjoyed their wonderful brunch menu. Everything from start to finish was spot on. Our waiter Doug went out of his way to ensure our experience was amazing. His service and personable touches added to our enjoyment.  Nice atmosphere,  Excellent food, and Impeccable service. What more can I say? Thank you for a memorable time!
17	1	This is the best Thai restaurant I have to been to.   Didn't expect the food here to be this amazing. It's located in a run down lot a little outside of the strip. Once you get inside the restaurant you see all tons of wine's behind a glass. A big restaurant clean inside that looks nothing like the horrible outside. Service is really attentive and makes sure your table is always clean.   The food here was superb. Next time I come here I'm only ordering the specialty dishes. The typical dishes are great but they have such an awesome menu that every dish we got blew my mind. The tom yum kai soup is delicious and you can't go wrong with that. The pad thai they use thin noodles which made me like it even more! The sea bass drunken noodles was crack. The fish itself was so tender it was like butter. The green curry was another highligh that felt like eating coconut butter on top of rice. I couldn't get enough of it. The raw beef tar tar was light and fresh. The fried rice was good but probably the least memorable of the dishes. Next time I come here I'm getting the deep fried prawns. If you visit Vegas make sure to stop by this place. You will not be disappointed.  Recommendation: Sea Bass Drunken Noodles, Pad Thai, and Green Curry
1221	0	Despite meeting Wilmer Valderrama, Mike Tyson, and Alonzo Mourning here, this place was an absolute nightmare.  We each paid $40 cover to cram onto the dance floor like packed sardines.  If I ever came here again, I'd stay outdoors the whole time.  Indoors is like driving in LA traffic...total buzzkill.
1265	1	This pizza is BOMB, period.   IMO, it's kinda cool that it's pretty much a hole in the wall and that they don't advertise it. One of those exclusive things where you have to know about it through word of mouth. Almost as if it were my own little secret.  As far as for you negative Nancys comparing this plave to NY. Get a grip, it's not New York, it's Las Vegas. You will never get NY pizza anywhere but NY. It's like going to NY to a casino (idk if they have them or not) and say well these arn't like Las Vegas...duuhhh.
559	1	Can you say the BeSt PiZzA eVeR!   If someone never told you about the secret pizza place you'd never know this place existed.  Luckily I came across a video on YouTube and had to give this place a shot.   When you find this place it's very small inside. Maybe enough to seat 4 or 5 people. The pizza is excellent and surprisingly not many were here.   Out of all the places we ate on our recent Vegas trip this was one of our favorite.
1880	0	Very high prices, poor quality food and painful karaoke makes this a mildly entertaining venue. Service is VERY slow; I suspect as a result of goo people spread thin. Consumer expectations are not high coming in but hey...it is an "experience" that out of towers enjoy...once.
1871	1	Best damn burger I've ever had. Kobe beef, bleu cheese and jalapeo bacon. Good gracious me. Fat fries were also yummy. Classic chocolate shake was a delicious dessert. I would like to minus a half star for the crappy pop music that played the entire time.
1641	1	I love this place. Probably the cheapest and most reasonable restaurant at this hotel. The line is long but I promise it's worth the wait. Pizza is not even one of my favorite foods, but I LOVE eating here. The most entertaining thing of this restaurant is being completely sober and coming her after the club closes to see all the drunks. hehehehehe
1728	0	I went here during a busy holiday weekend, and the buffet was PACKED. There were two options to get into the buffet: wait in line and pay the normal price (which I did and ended up waiting for nearly an hour), or pay the express line price. Those who paid the express line price got to zip through the line, but they got the same food for a lot more money. I didn't think it was worth it.   The food itself was good, and this buffet had lots of options. However, the service was abysmal. You have to write your drink order on a card instead of telling the waitress. We didn't know that, and we waited a while for the waitress to arrive. Once she did, we didn't have our card ready so she just left. I ended up not getting my drink until I had finished my first plate. That sucked. Plus, we never got refills. This place was definitely NOT worth the cost.
887	0	My girlfriend and I recently had an late dinner here and it was terrible. We had to wait in line for 20 minutes with 2 people ahead of us. The service is really slow and the staff was not friendly.  We had the chicken wings and the Greek salad, both were not that good.  We did not even eat a quarter of the food. I expected more from a place inside the Bellagio.
838	0	First of all, if you're in a Tix 4 Tonight line wondering whether or not you should buy a discount ticket to the Cravings buffet, I'd advise you to choose another place.  But more about that at the end of my review.  The food itself was nothing to get very excited about.  The high point was the Andouille sausage which had a kick to it and real flavor.  Ironically, the low point was the Cajun chicken, which looked the part but had little flavor and was so dry it was barely edible (and I prefer dry poultry to juicy).  The rest of the food, as many pointed out, was pretty bland, kind of like Golden Corral with less choices.  They do have free alcohol, so if you're more interested in drinking than eating, this may be the place for you.  I don't drink, so this was little consolation for me.  Another Yelper recommended getting a discount coupon.  I had one and came at about 1:00 PM for lunch.  The coupon (from Tix 4 Tonight) listed a lunch price of $11.99.  There were three of us, so I was expecting to pay about $40.  Imagine my shock when the Cashier announced my bill was about $80.  I told her I wanted lunch and she told me they weren't serving lunch "today."  I went ahead and paid and immediately checked their website on my phone only to discover today meant ever.  There is no reference to lunch, only Breakfast, Brunch and Dinner.  Is the Mirage or Tix 4 Tonight to blame for the bait and switch/misrepresentation?  I guess that's a question for the Nevada Attorney General to figure out, I'll update to post any response I get from them.  But given the cashier's slick reply I'm guessing it's the Mirage.
859	1	came here twice on my honeymoon.  such a delicious breakfast.  hard to go wrong here.  especially when you order the lyonnaise potatoes on the side.  the strawberry croissant is so delicious, i am still thinking about it.  luckily you can order it also at the separate bouchon bakery in the venentian.  love the quiche lorriane and the french toast.  it was all divine.
802	1	his place has redeemed itself.   I was lucky to be seated right away since I was there all alone. My waitress Amanda was there immediately to see if I had any questions and to take my drink order. She has a warm smile and made me feel very welcome. I ordered the Texas toast French toast with eggs and bacon. It was delicious. I also ordered a side of toast for which she asked if I wanted it buttered which usually they don't so that was great. The eggs were perfectly over medium and they were actually seasoned. Amanda was very attentive and was sure that I was not in need of anything. I also had the banana nut muffin it was one of the best I've had in a restaurant, I am a bit partial to my own.  I will say the service through out was exceptional from the moment I walked in until I left even thought the register had trouble reading the card I had.   The food would definitely be worth the wait, and the service I experienced was above expectations for how busy the are. Give it a try if you haven't been
1803	1	We've been fans of Ramsay's tv shows and had always wanted to actually taste his food. We found ourselves in Vegas, staying at the Paris.  We finally had our chance to enjoy a Ramsay steakhouse and we were not disappointed.  The famous beef Wellington was not of this world. Amazing. Kobe A5 beef - melt in your mouth. Creamed corn, mushrooms, Mac and cheese, dear god it was all frigging awesome.  You don't get flavors like these cheaply and it was not cheap. But who cares?!  This was a wonderful experience and we can't wait to get back!
272	0	what?!?!? really it is the hilton!!!! so many things went wrong! first we originally booked a king gave us a double... then they switched us out the next day only to have a clogged tub!!! then the room they switched us out.. people were still occupying it!! so the last room they gave us.. sink didn't work, tub was dripping really badly, and the phone didn't work!!! by then we were way exhausted to change rooms!!! the hallways were dirty! the rooms were dusty!!! etc!!! WE HATED IT!
338	1	Lots of hype around this place, and I can see why.  I came here last night to eat with some friends (ok more than a few...there were like 20 of us), and I was pleasantly surprised. We were all able to be seated, but I don't know how long the rest of the group was waiting to be seated, and I'm not sure if they made prior arrangements or whatever. (I don't know that this is really the best place for large groups though...the restaurant isn't that big). With such a big group, I thought we would be there forever waiting for food and everything. Not so...the staff were very friendly and everything was a lot faster than I thought it would be. I was actually pretty impressed with the speed. The staff were very attentive, and they joked around with us. Also, not once were our water glasses empty, which I really appreciated.  Anyhow, the food (which is why anybody is reading this review anyhow)... Oxtail chili cheese fries...fantastic! If you've never had oxtail, the meat is really tender and juicy, so it definitely adds a new dimension to chili fries. They also put an egg on it. Also, it's huge so consider sharing it.  I ordered the black and green burger and it was delicious! You can definitely taste the quality meat in it. the combination of ingredients was quite superb. I guess it's a fancy burger, and for a burger it is pricey, but I think it's worth it, at least once in a while. Definitely something unique.  I was quite satisfied, and had a great experience. :)
255	0	There's nothing really wrong with the cafe, for breakfast, except for the outrageous prices. $4.50 for a beverage? Give me a break. I'm willing to pay a premium price for a nice restaurant experience, but I demand better food, better service, and better/unique ambiance in return. Cafe Bellagio offers none of those for its sky high prices.   The Crab Cakes Benedict was pretty good, though not work withe $20. The plain Belgian waffles were also pretty good, but not for $10--the secret, I think, is they use a lot of vanilla.   Service was OK for a restaurant of that size. There was a wait of about 15 minutes to get a table, but that was at 10AM on a Saturday with a rush.   If it's a weekday and you insist on eating at the Bellagio, go for the buffet. Better deal, I think. Otherwise, go off strip. Your wallet and stomach will thank you--first when the bill comes, later when you have to pay it.
496	1	Las Vegas is my hometown and I am there a few times a year to visit family. Bachi Burger was built during my last year in Vegas before I moved to Boston literally two minutes away from my house.  Bachi has the best burgers I have ever tasted in my life. Hands down. I cannot find the words to describe them. I could search the volumes of Poe and Emerson and Twain and even their brilliance combined could not do poetic justice to this burger.  I have since adopted a vegetarian lifestyle and this burger is one of the few meats I miss eating. I still insist on going to Bachi Burger every time I am home for a visit. Their salt and pepper fries (with huge chunks of garlic and jalapeno) and garlic aioli are delicious and I love to snack on them.  If you like burgers, go have a bachi burger. If you don't like burgers, go anyway. It'll make you like burgers.   Oh, and my favorite Bachi memory? I took my boyfriend there for the first time for lunch. He and I were still hanging out at 7 pm and I asked where he wanted to go for dinner. At his request we went back to Bachi Burger.   While waiting to be seated a man walked in and asked us if we'd ever eaten there before. My boyfriend's response was, "Yeah, for lunch." The guy told us he had initially been at a restaurant down the street and asked the hostess there if Bachi was any good. She told him it was ok, but he decided to take our word for it.
1491	1	Bouchon has become one my favorite places not only in Vegas, but anywhere. The first time I went I thought the cheese course and the wine were excellent but that my dinner was not as exceptional. I will say that on my next visit everything was amazing. On both occasions I also thought the bill was pretty reasonable. That is not to say it's cheap, but I think it's reasonable and I have been charged a lot more for meals that were not nearly as nice.  I recommend the outdoor seating for those who are looking for a relaxing or romantic experience.
1634	0	Okay, definitely one of the greatest food disappointments I've experienced ever. For years I have heard of this infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate that I so deeply regretted opting out of during my visit to NY a few months back. So even after an enormous buffet lunch and an almost as equally large Thai dinner, I made sure that I could squeeze some of this drink in me. I am so sad to have wasted my stomach space.  The Frozen Hot Chocolate is nothing but a glorified Starbucks Frappuccino for triple the price. The cup size is way smaller than I had expected for an $11 drink. Perhaps you pay for the ambience and experience when you sit in the restaurant, but the to-go line is a definite no-go. The whipped cream is also coming out of a generic brand can, so it's also great knowing that you're paying for such fine quality. And the worst part of the night was the unfriendly worker who wouldn't give me a cup of tap water so that I could somehow manage to finish the overly sweetened, overly expensive, overrated cup of chocolate in my hand!
668	0	I came to this Buffett years ago, sometime in 2007 to 2009?  Oh it was great, the food was colorful and tasted great.  There wasn't much service back then as it is now but the food now is deplorable.  This is now a local's choice type of buffet rather than something you would want to eat as a tourist:  you are expecting high grade food when you visit.  Don't come here unless you're expecting just a morning pick me up from a lousy hangover.  Don't expect service either, although you are waving your hand, it will take them some time to stop talking and playing with the coffee spouts to come over and give you a new napkin.
1638	1	Not for the faint of heart. YES, everything you read about this location is true and when you go at night for dinner, it's especially scary but oh so worth the risk!   Once you step inside, it's as if you walked through the looking glass. The restaurant is huge, with a very large wine room that you can see through the glass walls. We didn't make reservations and our expected wait was 45 minutes for three but were seated in a short 15 minutes, just enough time to order drinks at the bar. Note that they only serve beer, wine (huge selection) and sake.  Service was efficient and our waiter was very helpful with suggestions. I was determined not to order regular dishes but was with some diners that aren't that adventurous, so no raw meat, liver or too spicy!  We ordered Tod Mun Plar, Garlic/Pepper Chicken Wings and Pad Thai. All were very good, fresh and more than enough to share for 4 but only three of us. Also, luckily we ordered  these typical dishes because it was all the non spicy eater in our group could eat, although the fish cakes had a little kick.  We ordered the Squid garlic, sauce was amazing, even just with rice! The waiter suggested the Braised Short Rib with Panang and Thai Basil Catfish. Here is where we tread the spicy fantastic. We specifically ordered mild and their mild is a regular joe's spicy! It was great and depth of flavors, even with the heat, were so good. Thankfully, the water server did her rounds regularly and filled our glasses each time!  The fifth star really is for the price. Six dishes and drinks for three (enough food for four) was under $100, unheard of for such great food, environment and service.
1028	1	I like to keep some of my beloved places a secret, but facing nostalgia at its best, saving Secret Pizza as my secret is cruel for pizza connoisseurs.   The fanciest pizza I've ever tasted was anything of the ordinary from the countless pizza parlours of Italy. To me, margherita pizzas were a real treat, gently wrapped in parchment paper at 2 a slice, and an additional 1,50 for sea salted chips.   However, there is something different about Secret Pizza. You can find this little gem on the third floor between the corners at the Cosmopolitan. Purchased by the slice or by whole, the open face kitchen allows you to choose your slice of heaven from white pizzas to red pizzas. When I first tasted Secret Pizza my friends purchased whole pies of everything pizza and a pepperoni pizza, and even at 2am, they were outstanding & melty, just the way I like my cheesy pies. On my last trip here I tried the white ricotta + sausage pizza which is now my only preference. Full of flavour with just the right strength of spice & herbs, this pizza was a winner on my taste buds.   Keep in mind that the line to Secret Pizza is absurd; I think the best option is to telephone in your whole pie only. Although I am not a pizza aficionado like I used to be when I was under 10 years old, I love Secret Pizza so much that I would purchase a whole pie for myself, even if my companion didn't like Pizza Secret! x
864	1	First let me say I am very critical of Breakfast spots. The staff here is great they are all in some form of Osh Kosh or Dickeys(one girl in Plus Four's, vest and pig tails). They were all shapes and sizes with ink and piercings. That alone made me happy! The wait was about 20min(If you have a large group be ready to wait a while, or be willing to break up into smaller partys) full bar makes the wait easy. The food is Huge, but tasty as hell. I wished there were more people at my table so there were more things to try. Oh well I'll be going back on a regular basis. I won't even get into the food I would just butcher the menu anyway. These guys have set the bar really high and have no competiton outside the casinos. If you are local try going on weekdays for shorter wait and less crowd. I wish there were more spots like this in Vegas! (!!!Don't be fooled into going to Hash House it is not the one!!!)
29	1	This place is ridiculously good. I do not hunk that I've had anything bad here.  The burgers are great, my favs are the spicy miso, and the kalbi. The pork belly and duck buns are great. People really like the oxtail chili fries, but they are not my favorite becaus the chili is too sweet and I can't really taste the oxtail a which I love. Service is always decent, never have a complaint
1022	1	We were originally getting a breakfast buffet at the Wynn and decided it was too pricey. Did a quick yelp search and Egg & I appeared.  To make the review short: the skillets were huge and nicely made. Prime rib benedict was on point. But the star? The warm muffin. Could just eat that for breakfast and nothing else.  Service is great too. Our server, Thay, took our group pictures voluntarily and filled our glasses and coffee mugs frequently. Awesome food and service makes for a great experience.   Casino buffets move aside. Come here for breakfast but leave a spot open for me.  5/5 would come again.
1404	0	Ok, ok, I get it. It's trendy to have lines "around the block" (around the escalator?) and ladies in rosepetal bathtubs as you walk in. But Tao Nightclub is trying way too hard to be cool - and makes you feel like you just walked into amateur night when you enter the club. I'm always expecting my opinion of this place to change, because the restaurant is great! Unfortunately, it's just an overhyped, overrated, overpacked club that happens to be in the middle of the strip.   Service is SUPER slow, drinks are super expensive, and the place is packed with fifty thousandaires who think that grabbing your ass is the best way to get a girl's attention. Sure, they have the occasional celebrity sighting, but there are so many better clubs to check out in Vegas. Eat at Tao. Skip the nightclub.
341	0	My wife and I were seated by the hostess and literally as we were sitting down an angry lady stormed over and said our spot is a reserved spot. We looked back for the hostess, who was long gone and the angry lady basically said can't sit here so get out of here. We had to chase down a hostess who eventually put us back in the same spot. It was weird, embarrassing and rude.   The food was very small portions and expensive for what it is. With all the good restaurants around, choose another.
845	1	Hey! watch out now.. cus the southwest is comin' up! Bachi Burger, MMMMM! I would end the review there.. But Bachi deserves more than that. Seriously, forget the burger truck. Bachi can stay right where it is and I'll come to them anytime. I've only been here once. Thanks to Yelp, it has led me here. But with my stomach willing and all... I would come here every day.  I came here with three others being all Bachi virgins. So we ordered a different burger each. That way we can try eachothers. The inside is fairly spacious and simple. I ordered the Bahn-Mi burger. I'm not sure what Bahn-Mi means, but I'd assume it's a vietnamese sandwich except in burger form. I got to try the ox-tail chili fries and the parmesan truffle fries. Both are deservingly tasty, but I love the parmesan truffle more. They had taro boba but no hot taro milk tea =/. What was more important was that the service was quick and friendly.
1034	1	I can't say enough good things about this place. Gordon Ramsey has really nailed it here. Every time I come to Vegas (and lately it's been fairly often) I need to stop by here.  Their burgers are spot on. Well constructed, great selection of flavors. They don't overdo it with the toppings. Even though there are several burger options to choose from, they change up the toppings just enough to give unique burger experiences, but still let the flavor of the beef shine. My favorites so far are the farm burger and the Brittania burger, you can't go wrong with either. Only downside is that the burgers are $15+. Whatever, worth it.  Where BurGR really shines though, is in the sides and shakes. Their truffle fries are the best fries I've ever had and their jalapeo poppers are out of this world. The Oreo milkshake is unlike anything I've ever seen before. Oreo milkshake, creme brle, whipped cream, and an Oreo cookie in top. Jesus take the wheel.
1811	0	It was my first time to visit the place with my friends and we were allstarving after walking along the strip. We were told we had to wait for 30 mins which we thought was ok since we were all tired anyway and we can just sit outside. aft about 40 mins, we checked on it with t he hostess and we were told that we were called already and they will just put us again on the top list. We found this so impossible since we were just outside with othere who were on the waiting list. after about 5 mins, the lady showed us our table. I called oneof the hostess and told her that we are all ready to order. To our surprise she said "I am not your server" and left. We were all shocked and sat for 15mins asking ourselves who to call then when the hostess itself was not interested to help us?! We then called another girl and told her "Can we have someone who can get our orders?".  Foodwise- it was A ok, i ordered the pepper vodka pasta. Proportion is average and foor was freshly cooked. My friend ordered the sundae thing and it was good. The waitress was checking on us from time to time which i think was good considering that we were stil not over with the hostess' attitude. I guess, the servers know that people will still go to their place and they dont have permanent customers since its a tourist's place that is why they are not after good customer service.  My suggestion is, just  go for take out. Dine in experience is terrible!
1338	0	Must be a nostalgia thing. The wife always wanted to try one as she had family who loved these. Neither one of us can figure what the draw is. Not real burger tasting or anything to make it stand out. If you just want to say you had one then give it a go, at least it's not real pricey.
1434	1	Never disappointed whenever I go here. I live pretty far from the strip so this is a treat whenever I'm near the location! It's one of the better places to go for casual burgers, shakes, fries, etc! I love it so much and shakes are pretty good and I love the changing of the flavors they offer. I recommend this place over In N Out (sorry ) my boyfriend always tells his friends from out of town about this place and they also end up loving it too!
130	0	I guess memorial day weekend was not a good time for tao. Everyone was pissed because we were all there to see Kaskade who didn't even come on until 2. it was supposed to be a 6 hour set and along with that all of the employees kept saying he was coming on at 1. Maybe it would be better to go on a not so popular weekend. I literally couldn't even walk without being seriously scared that I was going to die by stampede. Other than that the decor was cool and if you eat at the restaurant girls are free and guys are half off. It was alright...
0	1	Enjoyed the food very much. Reminded me so much of Korea.   Its just like the traditional korean bbq where you cook on the grill in front of you. Ordered the marinated kalbi, bulgogi, duck, and steam egg. Will definitely come back and bring more friends.
1575	0	I expected better from here. The sliders weren't that tasty and became a chore to eat after a while. The chicken rings tasted like frozen dino nuggets (not even as good as Dino nuggets). I also had the vanilla milkshake, which was pretty good. It tasted like an In N Out shake, but sweeter. The fries weren't that bad either, I would eat them again. Lastly, the onion chips were probably the best out of the whole meal; they were really crispy and delicious.   Overall, I wouldn't come back here by choice but it wasn't a HORRIBLE experience. Their staff was friendly and service was quick, impressive since it's pretty full..being on the strip and all. All and all, i say come and try it out for yourself. It just didn't meet my expectations.
571	0	As a vegan, I could only really judge on the selection of veggies and random vegan-friendly items. Buffets are usually my time to get creative with what is available to me. The Spice Market Buffet looked especially fun since it featured your basic global cuisines.  At the salad bar I stocked up on grilled bell peppers, asparagus, brussel sprouts, olives, and other veggies that were not very memorable. Next I perused the Mexican food bar in hopes to top certain veggies with guacamole. Unfortunately, the guacamole looked sad, grey, and machine processed.  The Mid-Eastern bar looked much more promising while I filled my plate with hummus, dolmas, tabouli, pita, and if I remember correctly, some kinda of zucchini dish.  Overall, I was glad that there was a sufficient amount of options for me. However, all of it tasted as if these options were after thoughts. Nothing very exciting here. To top it off, the staff all had this "FML" attitude about themselves. From the cashiers to the hostess to the servers. Geez, get a better job if you all hate it so much.  The next day we went to Le Village Buffet at Paris which was way better food, service, and atmosphere. It made The Spice Market Buffet look like a Sizzler.
219	1	My husband and I went there on 2/19/2014, our last "full" night in Vegas this past trip.  I always wanted to try it but noticed it was rather pricey so I wanted to see what the consensus was before dishing out big bucks.  It was well worth the price though that's for sure.  We are already thinking about what we are going to order the second time around.  Our waiter was Dennis, don't recall the assistant's name but they were both nice.  We did wait a little bit though, which if the prior reviews didn't boast about the excellent service I probably would not have noticed and would have chalked it up to them being very busy.  Prior reviews were correct about the bread selection- all very good.  The salt on the butter was the BOMB!  We skipped appetizers and opted to save room for dessert.  My husband ordered the bone-in rib eye and I had the American rib cap.  For our sides we selected the mac/cheese and the truffle fingerling potatoes.  Let me just say- I could have just had the sides as my entree because they were both excellent.  Rich and decadent.  I almost felt guilty eating them.  But they were so good.  And let me say the day after they were just as good.  The American Rib cap, which I never heard of before, was excellent.  8 ounces seemed small but it was packed with flavor and with the sides, well I couldn't finish it.  That too tasted good the day after.  My husband's rib-eye although BIG was just alright.  Meaning we've had bone-ins before.  His had a little more gristle than we prefer so he's thinking he'll go with the rib cap next time.  For dessert, we went with the sticky toffee pudding even though I was a little reluctant after trying the one at BurGR- it was a little too sweet for my taste.  But the one here, at the steak place, was excellent.  It wasn't too sweet at all.  We are ready to go back on our next trip.
49	0	We had to pay almost $5.00 for a bowl of RICE!  I could not believe that the main dish did not come with anything else.  Everything is ordered separately.  I know it's Caesar's at the Las Vegas strip, but please, four entrees, four bowls of rice and three teas, one had water, cost over $100 for lunch!!!
1801	1	Waited about an hour, and I say it was worth it.  We did have a party of 7, so it took longer for us to get seated.  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries which were really good, and the fried egg on top was the kicker.  I got the Miyagi burger, and a couple other people got the crabby patty.  Burgers and service were good.  Will definitely come back when we are in vegas again.
1259	0	I'm not too satisfied with Serendipity. I ordered their coffee (very expensive, but reasonable for Vegas) and their strawberry cheesecake dessert (insanely expensive and super fatty/not worth it). The reason I give it 2 stars is b/c of their poor service. It's a horrible place. It took us 10 minutes to get seated for 2 people, 10 minutes to even order, and they GAVE US THE CHECK 5 minutes into the dessert. What the heck is that service? It's common courtesy to give the check when requested, unless it's a fast food place I can understand. Overall, I'm not going back. Nor should you.
1168	0	OMG, I thought Harrah Southern California had A bad buffet, this place was nasty. The bun was literally as hard as a rock I could not bite into it for real. Waited 10min at salad section as they have to make your salad and gave up waiting. The desserts look like they sat all day the lemon meringue pie has started to flatten on the plate. NEVER AGAIN all 4 of us agreed
1959	0	Worse wait I've experienced.  Most people who spend money on the strip are people on vacation.  I don't know about you, but I don't like wasting my vacation standing around.  There was a coupon for a free frozen hot chocolate with the purchase of an entree, so I went to check it out.  I've seen pictures, and it looked so large and delicious.  Turns out, there was an hour wait to be seated.  I opted to forgo the coupon, and stand at the walk-thru window instead.  Horrible decision.  There were two parties ahead of me, but there were only two workers, so they took the order, made the order, then served the next customer.  The wait took over a HOUR.  I've never had such a horrible wait.    When I got the frozen hot chocolate, I ordered the one for 2.  It didn't look as large in a dinky plastic cup.  In fact, they only put about 2/3s of what they put in the blender in my cup.  The hot chocolate was good, but it wasn't worth the price.  It tasted cheap, like powdered hot chocolate, and blended ice.  I've tasted better frozen hot chocolates, and they are generally made with syrup, for a creamier more integrated flavor.  Overall, I was disappointed with my experience.  It doesn't taste bad, and the decor was interesting, so I give it a 2/5
1684	0	I've lost my wonder for Serendipity. The first time I came here I was so excited and maybe that made the experience better, but to be honest this last time, it was MEH. I don't think Ill return again- it's one of those places where your like "okay been there done that, no need to try again". The portion are large but not that flavorful, kind of boring and expensive. Our table ordered breakfast and two frozen hot chocolates. The cookies and cream frozen hot chocolate is still the best, I strayed and ordered the Amaretto one, which was okay, but I felt like there was only a tiny bit of almond flavoring- so after the first few sips the flavor was gone. For breakfast we ordered the breakfast quesadilla and the breakfast sandwich- for the price I would rather of made these at home.   So I guess my point is go once, just to say you tried it, skip on the food and just get the frozen hot chocolate.
1737	1	Made an effort to try a Thomas Keller restaurant and was not disappointed at all. Highly recommended!! We had the croque madame and its one of the best I've had. The monay sauce was not overwhelming, the rich melted cheese goes well with the ham and the brioche was perfectly made. Generous portions of well cooked fries! Will definitely come back!
33	0	This place is awful and I can't even believe Caesars palace allows this place to stay in business. When I think of quality I think of Caesars and this was not it.  I have been there before and it wasn't that good so i thought maybe they were having an off day but it seems that's standard operating procedure.  We had the beef brisket noodle soup and it was awful. The beef was 3 chunks of boney fatty I don't even want to call it beef that would be an insult to the cow. The soup was cold! It's a noodle company according to the name and they can't even warm up the soup?!  For $16 I could of eaten an entire smorgasbord in Chinatown for that price. I also had the red bean bun and it was the worst red bean bun I have ever had.  You can go into Chinatown and have dim sum and get the best red bean buns at Orchid Garden.  If I was from Beijing I would be insulted that they were trying to pass this off as something from there.  It was very disappointing.  I guess I'm gonna have to go to Chinatown to get a descent bowl of noodles and hand made red bean buns.
476	0	This hotel was chosen for it's price tag. But I would NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!!  I would rather sleep in a rental car.  The hotel is very run down. Maintenance is in over their heads and housekeeping seems to overlook even the most obvious details of cleaning a room.  In order to open the jammed door to our room, you had to lift up and push. The door had broken pieces and dents near the door knob, which makes me believe someone attempted to break into that room at one point. Management apparently doesn't deem this a necessary fix. The bathtub was filthy... Nothing a good scrubbing couldn't fix, but it had a ring around it... As if housekeeping repeatedly bypassed scrubbing the bathtub. It's the first bathroom I refused to use due to uncleanliness. The floor was sticky like it had been mopped with a dirty mop, so I chose to keep my shoes on. My "non-smoking" room was DEFINITELY smoked in and it smelled moist and musky.  The TV didn't work, but maintenance came and brought us a new cable to get it working again. Someone had stolen the cable to the TV. The walls are thin. BUT THE VERY WORST PART: My partner woke up in the middle of the night with a sudden breakout/reaction on both of his eyes.  The DIRTY BEDDING caused this. We left immediately and did not even finish our nights stay. After leaving it cleared up very quickly. He hadn't suffered from a reaction like that since he was a child. But because of past experience, he knew it was an allergic reaction to all the dust and smoke in the room. We were offered another room but not a refund.  I recommend going next door to the Howard Johnson on Tropicana!!!  The rooms are dated but ALWAYS clean and never smell like smoke!!! Not to mention, the price tag is also cheap so you have more money for other things!
779	0	Clean and sterile like an operating room.....  Such a strange feeling to walk into Lee's Sandwiches, which is not quite a yogurt store, grocery store, or a sandwich shop, but some type of odd mixture.  There are overpriced "Imported from France" goods for sale on a few shelves throughout the store.  It's a random selection of cookies, teas, and other things you probably wouldn't buy when you're cruising for a sandwich.  The yogurt machines are on the wall, like you would see at a yogurt store, but I'm not sure about the topping selection; it looked sparse at best.   Now, onto the sandwiches.  The menu on the wall above the registers is big and colorful.  The pictures look exactly like the sandwiches do, which normally would be a great thing, but here it's a disappointment.  I went with the BBQ Pork sandwich.  These are in the style of Bhan Mi, but really subpar.  The bread is missing that great crisp you expect from a baguette.  The flavor of the sandwich was muted as well, and even biting into big slices of jalapenos and bunches of cilantro I couldn't really get into the sandwich.    There is now a $10 CC minimum if you plan on using plastic, but really, you're better off just going somewhere else.
1468	1	Definitely one of the top five burgers of my life and I have had a few.  Natural source beef, smoked Gouda cheese, pepper bacon, and truffle mayo.  Order that and thank me later.  Beyond the phenomenal food Burger Bar gets five stars for the following reasons.  1.Our waiter Sergio (I think) took great care of us.  Good recommendations and excellent timing.  2.  The prices are cheap by Vegas standards.  Burgers for two with a fry sampler and a few beers came in around ~50$.  3.  The hostess made a mistake and seated us in a section that was set to be occupied by a large group.  We were seated for maybe 5 minutes when the manager came over, apologized profusely and politely asked us to move a few booths down.  Our group was fine with his apology and had no problem with moving.  He insisted on knocking 20% off our bill which was an unneeded but nice gesture.  The manager also made sure to check on us and seemed genuinely concerned that we had a good time (which we did).  4.  They had an excellent beer selection.  Over the last few years I have been happy with good beers making their way to Vegas and Burger Bar has jumped on that bandwagon.  I had a few Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA and there were three or four more beers I would have gladly ordered.   Burger Bar.... we will definitely be back.
1184	1	Hard to find but worth the search!! Just don't come too hungry cuz you'll be frustrated if you get lost looking for this place. =)  NY style pizza with classic flavors - they really do it right here. $4 a slice of cheese, $5 a slice of pepperoni or 1 topping. Kinda pricey for a slice but well worth it!
123	1	Located in Planet Hollywood, Gordon Ramsay Burgr can be found near the front entrance to the right of the Miracle Mile Shop entrance.  There were only 2 in my group, so the wait was not too long.  I'd imagine a larger group would have a longer wait, especially during a peak time.  I had already planned to order fries and a burger.  My waitress told me that the burgers can sometimes take a while to cook, so she suggested that I have my fries come out first so I'd have something to munch on.  Worked for me, but something to note in case you're sensitive about that type of thing.  If you order the sweet potato fries, go ahead and tell your server that you're going to need an extra serving of the honey jalapeno mayo that comes with it.  That stuff alone could get 5 stars.  It is so good.  Also, the order of fries was large enough to share between two people.  For my burger, I ordered the Farm Burger.  It's served with cheddar, duck breast bacon and a fried egg.  In case you missed that, I said duck breast bacon.  This was a delicious burger.    One helpful piece of info, if you are a Total Rewards member and show your card, you can get special pricing that comes out to a $1 off several items.  It's free to join at the Total Rewards desk found in the casino.
1476	0	You know that one all-you-can-eat dining hall on your undergraduate college campus? That's where I felt like I was when I stepped foot into the spice market.  I spent most of my time chowing down on the crab legs to get the best bang for my buck, and succeeded with crushing atleast 3 full plates of them, but  I also tried to stuff myself with some of the other buffet offerings. The crab legs themselves were pretty good, but I've had better. Nothing else I tried was really all that great. The baked desserts were dry, the soups were overly salty, and the other foods did not taste very fresh.  Priced at $35/pp my first Vegas buffet experience was pretty disappointing, and I was expecting so much more... but no worries, it's definitely not my last. At least they had a mexican bar where I could make my own guac and chips? Guac is my kryptonite.
239	0	I came here for the first time to eat dinner with my friends and I must say I wasn't impressed. While the waitress was very friendly, it didn't make up for the lack of effort put into making the food. I decided to try their "world famous wings" since it appeared to be the most popular menu item. After a very long time waiting, my wings arrived and they were very cold. I couldn't bring myself to eat very many and just found a few that were warm.  Would I say I had a good first time? not really.  Would I go here again? probably not, ill just stick to Wing Stop.
1081	1	Taking into account location, comparable places nearby, pricing, and of course the quality of food, it is impossible to rate this place any lower than 5 stars. Really cool place that makes you feel as if you've stepped out of the Cosmopolitan and into any hole-in-the-wall pizza across America. The pizza was great, but the real winner for us was the cheesecake. $4.50 for a giant piece that easily feeds two hungry people. There was no line when we went (around noon on New Years Eve). The ONLY complaint was there being nowhere to sit, but even that isn't a big deal since there is seating everywhere in the Cosmo.
8	1	The food was great!   Our waitress was very occupied though, because I had to ask another waitress twice to get her.  We ordered the buffalo chicken rolls and they were delicious!  Crisp, hot and very good flavor. Then I got the pasta and salad lunch portion.  My pasta was very good. I ordered the Carbonara. A little too much peas for me, but after I picked a few off the top, it was good.  The salad was a small portion of greens on the side, but was perfect since the appetizer filled me up.  I also ordered a Blanco Sangria and it was just a 3 out of 5.  Drinkable, but wouldn't order again.   I really enjoyed the food, so I am still giving this a 5 regardless of the drink and service.  I will return.
1828	1	First of all, you would NEVER know how to find this place unless you were specifically looking for it. It's off the strip in an area of town you wouldn't normally want to visit... I mean, unless you're interested in the transvestite strip club down the plaza. Who knows, maybe that's your thing? :)  Anyway... if you do happen to read a review or have someone in Vegas (a cab driver or another local?) recommend this place, it's for good reason... it's simply amazing.   You would never guess from the outside... or for that matter the interior (unless you examined ALL the celebrity pictures up and down the walls of course) that this place was in fact just simply amazing in every possible way. The wait staff is knowledgeable and extremely helpful, the food is DELICIOUS and with a full service bar even if the food takes some time (which in my experience it doesn't) you can enjoy some nice drinks.   Best of all? IT'S AFFORDABLE!!! Get five star food for two $$ prices...   Just go here, that is all.
1643	1	Had to wait in line for about 30 minutes to get seated for two people. So come hungry, but be prepared to wait for a seat.   Once we were seated we opened up the menu and couldn't help but to laugh when we saw Gordon Ramsey's picture as you open up the menu into the delightful curated menu. Everything sounds as delicious as the menu makes it. We took a recommendation from our waitress and ordered the jalapeo poppers to start off. And phew they were spicy! Delicious, and very flavorous with spices that are not expected. Definetly kicks you awake.  After that I had ordered a Aoili burgr. It was absolutely delicious, so very rich with flavor. That it was overwhelming to finish the big burger in one sitting. So I definetly took a quarter of it for munchies later as well as the jalapeo poppers. Had a great experience here and would definetly recommend it for anyone else visiting planet Hollywood or the strip in general!
625	1	Went here a month ago and then went again this past week...this place just gets better and better!  This time we ordered the American Kobe Beef burger...the meat was so tender and juicy and it made all the difference!  We also ordered the Cobb Salad which I expected to be just OK but it was EXCELLENT!  The wait staff was also super friendly/attentive which makes the experience all the better.
658	1	Open 24 hours a day, gigantic portion sizes, and a relaxed atmosphere...Grand Lux Cafe was the perfect late-night place to go after dancing!  Since we were staying at the Venetian, we stumbled upon this place all three nights we were there and it never let us down.  We were seated right away, the waitstaff was very attentive, and the place always had a pretty good crowd no matter what the time.    The menu is huge (and again, seriously, the portions are too), but we managed to navigate some delicious food...calamari, pizza, and potato spring rolls were among some of our favorites!  This place is a must for anyone looking for a late-night snack.  I'll definitely be back...
650	0	First of all, I and most of the people reviewing this place wrote this review to receive a free dessert for mentioning my server's name - Jorge. The food here is really not worth the price. The meat is hardly seasoned and the selection is terrible. One of their "12 cuts of meat" offered is pineapple. You would be better off just going to Texas de Brazil for better food for a better price. Also don't waste your money on all you can eat shrimp, it was served room temp with shell on and like most of the stuff here tasted like nothing.   Final note ; the free dessert looked nothing like the other desserts they had around the place, it ended up being a dry brownie with some chocolate icing on top.

Nothing terrible, but a lot of little irritations. - if you don't want to valet, you are directed to a different entrance so that you get to schlep your luggage a few hundred yards to check-in. That is just tacky. (but it's Vegas baby!) - after we checked in, late, tired, a guy behind the desk caught us and started trying to pressure sell some sort of prepay three nights get a free night deal. Again, tacky (but it's Vegas baby!) - I'm 6'1" tall, the shower head sat at around 5'3". I really hate turning into a pretzel to wash my hair. - First night, we checked into a room, and the A/C was broken. To their credit they quickly moved us to a new room, but there the TV was broken. The property is a bit tired and needs some work. - To their credit, we forgot an item, we called while on the road, they went up to the room, found it, put it in their property room, and we claimed it when we returned. I ding them because I know they can do better. I have had excellent experiences in other Hiltons.
377	1	Cents here for breakfast due to a coupon we got for buy 1 get 1. My wife and daughter shared a waffle and egg meal. I had the chile relleno omelet.   We left feeling full and the meals kept us going all day long. We never needed or wanted lunch.  The food was very good. The potatoes were a little salty, but not overly so. The hot sauces they provide added just the right flavor to the omelet.   The waffle looked huge and was crisp despite being topped with strawberries and cream.   Very good value for the money. Well be back next time we're in town.
284	0	Our friend convinced us to check out Cravings buffet before the Love show and boy were we sorely wrong about this place. We came at 5pm and the food selection was temperature cold and we are not talking about the raw bar but the cooked heated food sections.  The only thing at the raw bar are crab legs.  The prime rib was not flavorful---lacked a distinct beef taste even with the Au Jus--remember to include the au jus...you'll need it since it is soooo dry and bland. The roast turkey was also bland and uneventful...thankfully they have turkey gravy a few feet away.   The Chinese and Japanese sections were terrible....the singapore rice noodles were overly seasoned with soy sauce which destroyed the curry flavor. the fried rice and steamed rice were colder than ice cream. the fried rice was overly seasoned with soy sauce.  the roast pork and duck were lifeless and bland...i've had better in Hong Kong....so don't expect much in this section.  the italian and latin foods were also bland, salty and cold.   TIP: if you want hot food, eat whatever you pick right then and there since by the time you get to your table, the food will be cooooooooooooold.   the only lifesaver was the service from our waiter...he was great and made the experience better....  the food is TERRRRRRRRRIBLE --- COLD, BLAND, SALTY and VARIETY CHALLENGED....SAVE your $ and avoid even the early bird special and go to the Wynn.
609	1	We eat Thai food all over the country as we're traveling. We've been eating here for over 10 years.The food is still excellent and the service is as well. We had a bump this time. I called on Thursday for reservations on Saturday night at 6 o'clock but when we arrived there was no reservation on their books. (Still not sure if that was their mixup or mine. Make sure when you call that they take your first and last name.)   They worked us in as fast as they could, which ended up being about 20 minutes. It is difficult, sometimes, to get through to even make a reservation, but it is WORHT IT!   We had garlic prawns, crispy duck with drunken noodles, Larb from the Northern Menu and a sliced beef in coconut dish from the Chef's Choice menu - all four dishes were excellent. Don't miss the coconut ice cream on hot sticky rice.   Lotus of Siam is still a favorite.
1133	1	after spending a night and half the morning at the palms burning tons of calories on the dance floor i figured that i needed to refuel.  earlier in the day i had been told by some people at the wynn that the best late night/early morning eats could be had here.    i am not gonna lie. at first i was a bit skeptical. after spending a few too many hours gambling at the $5 blackjack tables at circus circus the night before i happened across this place on my way back the wynn.  maybe it was the bitterness from the money i lost. maybe it was the on-setting alcohol poisoning. whatever it was, i was less than impressed.  ladies and gentlemen of yelp. i implore you. do not judge a book by its cover. because this place is a gem. i ordered nachos. (my new go to for late night eats). a platter of nachos the size of a sewer lid was placed in front of me. and they were delicious. in fact they gave me exactly what i needed: greasy, fatty, awesomeness.  i could not even finish half. i am not even joking. and the nachos were not the only large portioned meal. there were more leftovers on the table than food in our collective stomachs.   so a few tips for your next vegas visit:  1.) drink and dance until about 6 am  2.) go to the peppermill 3.) order the nachos 4.) enjoy the deliciousness  youre welcome.
1111	0	My friend and I came here on December 21st for dinner after it was recommended to us by the Tix4tonight because it was close to our show's location.  We thought... meh why not?   The ambiance of the place was pretty good and the waitstaff there were very hospitable - the only aspects that prevents it from getting one star. Other than that, I would definitely not go back.  The food, first of all, was HORRIBLE.  For the price of almost $30, I've never been to a buffet more terrible than this one.  Basically, it's an International Buffet with foods: Chinese, Japanese, Latin, Italian, BBQ/roasted meats, seafoods... and of course all-you-can-drink beer, wine and non-alcoholic stuff.  The crab legs were tasteless, sushi rolls were unimpressive (rice was too hard), their Chinese food consisted mostly of North Americanized creations.  At the Italian stations, their food was lukewarm.   I've walked around the buffet many many circles to find things I'd like to eat but unfortunately didn't have too many things on my plate.  Besides the dessert station which was okay, their food selection, variety and quality was inadequate.  When tasting the food, it just doesn't taste fresh and we were both really really disappointed.
1347	1	We had reservations at 5pm on a Friday. We wanted reservations at 6pm but couldn't get in. We were concerned it was too early but really had no choice. It turned out prefect because our server asked about our plans for the evening & we told him we had a show to catch at 9 so he planned the timing of our courses. They took their time & brought everything out at a prefect time! Loved it! That was so thoughtful of them!  I have to say we had the best time, meal & service at Gordan Ramsay Steak during our short stay in Vegas! The atmosphere was nice & dim even though it was a little loud in there. We had oysters on the half shell, foie gras, ribeye, lamb, truffle fingerling potatoes, asparagus, bone morrow & the sticky toffee pudding.   Oysters were prefect! There were 3 different kinds of oysters & it came with 3 different sauces to top off. The foie gras was amazing! It was our first time having foie gras. I've seen what it looked like but wasn't sure how the taste & texture was. We loved it & will definitely have it more often! The foie gras had a nice sear on the outside & it came with 2 small pop overs that had gooseberries & gooseberry sauce. It was delicious! Everything paired so nicely! The ribeye was cooked to perfection! There was a nice char on the outside from the grill & the inside was nice & medium rare, how we ordered it. It didn't come with sides so we ordered the truffle fingerling potatoes - it was just ok to me & the asparagus -this was delish! Cooked perfectly! The lamb came with 1 lamb chop, a small Shepards pie, roasted carrots & mashed potatoes. Loved everything except the pie was too salty for me. The bone morrow was just ok. I've had better. I didn't care for that green sauce on top. Not even sure what it was. The dessert, sticky toffee pudding was to die for!!!!!! It was like a small cake & they poured toffee sauce on top & it came with brown butter ice cream shaped like a stick of butter. Heaven!! Soooooo good! The coffee came in a french press & they even provided 3 complimentary chocolate spoons (had alky in it) to stir into your coffee. I passed on that since I'm pregnant but hubby tried it. Be careful, he said it was pretty sweet so you might not want to use all the chocolate.  Very pricy but definitely a must try, at least once.
205	0	Worst buffet I have been to in Vegas. Very old and cold food. The best thing was the dessert and even that wasn't great. The creme brle was just vanilla pudding. Very, very disappointing. I would rather eat fast food. Highly suggest going to another buffet.
1370	0	Dinner Buffet was very limited.  What they did have was good, but who ever heard of a dinner Buffer without fried chicken or baked potatoes?  Salad bar was weak.  Breakfast Buffet was much better with French toast, 3 types of scrambled eggs, 3 types of sausage, pancakes, waffles.  Breakfast - Yes.  Dinner - No.
1197	0	This was my 4th time staying at this hotel for a convention next door and I will never go back!  The last 3 years I have been downgraded from the Grand Room to a crappy room and all they offer me is a smoking room when I have complained.  I don't know why they take reservations they are unable to fulfill. This year the lady at the front desk double talked me and said we have been upgraded from the Grand room to a resort club room for an extra $10 per night.  When we got up to the room, it turned out to be another crappy room.  I immediately called down to the front desk to complain but was told they sold out of Grand rooms.  They considered me upgraded because my room was supposed to have robes, slippers & a free bottle of water, NONE of which was in our room.  I was told to call housekeeping about getting those items sent up.  We were also given gold keys to another room on another floor, which apparently had food and drinks but only open limited hours so we never did have a chance to see that.  So, thats what they considered an "upgrade" and tried to charge me more for.  I ended up calling the manager the next day and they took $30 off but to me it wasn't worth it at all.   The room was supposedly updated but it looked the same as it did the last 4 years, broken lighted mirror and not vacuumed.   Bottom line is I will never go back!
1936	1	Best burgers hands down. Eating at one of Ramsey's restaurants is like my life long pursuit as I've been a big fan of his for years. After studying the menus from 3 Ramsey's restaurants in Vegas, we decided on this one simply because it fits our budget .   Went there at night and the wait was 2 hours, so we came back the next day and tried lunch instead, got in right away. We tried their blue burger and farm burger (with duck breast bacon and fried egg) and requested them medium rare and they were absolutely cooked to perfection. The outside was evenly cooked and the inside was pink and just melt in our mouths. Ramsey definitely delivered and we were not disappointed!!  The fries were great too with homemade ketchup and aioli sauce. The #4 shake of Oreo and Creme brle was creative and not bad. What was not good was the dessert "sticky toffee pudding push-up pops". They tasted just like vanilla ice cream layered with chocolate cake while they were supposed to be salted peanut ice cream. So don't order that.   Overall though I still give it 5 stars because the burgers were truly the best we had ever had. And now I can finally say I've eaten at one of Ramsey's restaurants.
1122	1	The best brunch on the strip!!!  Since they don't take reservations for brunch but recommend coming in earlier to avoid longer wait, I along with my friends got there around 9:30 and were seated within a few mins.  From the first moment you step on you can feel the cheerful/bright ambiance. Service, decor, and creativity all are bound to win your heart.  The food is definitely authentic french and hence even the French toast aren't the traditional ones you get at the American brunch restaurants. Not to say it was anything short of delicious.  Overall I had a great time and can't wait to get back for round 2 the next time I'm in that city.
1615	1	It was my first time here and everything is absolutely perfect ! Here is open 7/24 and they serve perfectly altough it's 2:30 am ! I got fettucini alfredo w mushroom and i can say that these guys make it better than little itally. To be honest here is the one of the best place to eat in Las Vegas...
810	0	The service is so horrendous it's laughable. The food is mediocre at best. Came in with a party of 7. The place was busy, but not insane. I ordered a skinny margarita. Not bad. After I got my drink I had decent expectations. Table got guac and chips. Not very good albeit expensive. My chicken quesadilla was greasy and tasted like canned chicken. My boyfriend got fish tacos, and they were a little better, but bland.  Our server was basically non-existent. My friend had to ask three different ppl for a lemon for her water. The food runner brought her some, after a ridiculous wait for our food. We would have ordered more cocktails, however we didn't get the opportunity to.  Don't even bother. This is Vegas. There are much better restaurants. My wallet hurts from the price gouge.
1061	0	Tao Nightclub deserves this 1 star, but it's also getting 1 start to outweigh the review that my friend posted for a 4 star review.....but he can't count his experience!!!  He had an all expenses paid trip to LV and all drinks were paid for at Tao by Virgin Airlines and not to mention it was on a Wednesday night!!  Seriously!  Tao is COMPLETELY overrated.  The dance floor is tiny, there are columns in the way so you can't even people watch if you are one of the wall flowers, the bartenders (male and female) are REALLY bitchy and the service is terrible.  The millions of buddha faces start to look scarey after awhile and the atmosphere is stuffy.  No me gusta!  Pure is a MILLION times cooler than this place.  I went twice and haven't returned, I'll leave it for the celebrities who are paid to be there or my friends who get free trips to Vegas and free drinks at Tao! ;)
532	1	Out of all the years I've been coming to the Peppermill it's been the same ever since I love this place but tonight tonight for some reason there are about 15 to 20 beautiful knock dead gorgeous women here they don't know me from Adam or all they want to do is go out and partay I'm down for that taxi all later O
897	0	No.  Obviously you don't have very high expectations when going to a place like this.. it's basically a glorified bar.. and this location is on the Las Vegas Strip...and to basically mimic what another reviewer said: the service was sloooow - and the food was GROSS.   I ordered a 'chicken fajita burrito'.. which came to he table as a 'BEEF fajita burrito'.. about 35 minutes after it was ordered..AND it had CHILI all over it... like beef chili.. slopped over the top.. along with fake canned cheese.. which I guess would be fine, if that is what I had ordered.. and i was extremely drunk.  It was incorrect.. it looked unappealing.. but hey, I gave it a chance. Sufficed to say, I won't be going back for that particular menu item. (I did mention to the server that it was incorrect... he claimed they sent the wrong one, and I said I would deal with it.. but on the bill, it was listed as BEEF Fajita Burrito..as in.. he ordered the wrong item and lied to me about it.) Mistakes happen.. I get it... I'm just sayin.  The 2 friends I was with, both decided it was pretty bad service as there were missing utensils, drinks for the 3 of us were coming one at a time.. and there really seemed to be no excuse for the lack in service, because they were not at all busy.   We all agreed that the drinks weren't bad.. and the outdoor patio is a nice attraction to ''people watch' from .. but other than that.. I will not be eating any of their "signature" dishes again...ever. They had chicken tenders with fries on the menu, and if I ever visit this spot again to have drinks.. and decide that I am hungry (and very lazy, because there are 10 better choices less than 50 feet away, ) I will be having those.   I don't recommend the food at all. The drinks were good and the Jeremiah Sweet Tea Vodka(?) Drink.. was tasty albeit very  sweet... but I did have 2! Anyway.. that's that.. good luck in your dining adventures!
450	0	Walking down Las Vegas Blvd on a sweltering summer afternoon, passing all of these more or less rock bottom priced beer and drink places, we made The Mistake of Massive Proportions and went into Diablo's. Why? It looked good from the outside. And it had those two magic words: Happy and Hour.  We ordered two margaritas, chips and salsa. In Vegas. Where drinks are more or less free. The Diablo "margaritas" were more like watered down 99 Cents Store Lemon Lime sodas and the chips came with three tiny wasabi-sized bowls with non-spicy salty green sauces.   The bill: $32! I asked, "Isn't this Happy Hour?" But my real question should have been, "Happy for who?" Oh, and the $32 included a $4 CHARGE for the chips and salsa!!! WTF!!! When was the last time you paid for chips and salsa? Uh... never!   Moral: Don't judge a book by its cover. Especially when it's called Diablo's. Better you go sell your soul somewhere else.
36	0	I really was expecting more from this. My mac and cheese was kinda bleh. I figured a place that was known for hot chocolate...er frozen, whatever...would have comfort food down pat. Getting seated was kind of a nightmare, and the atmosphere was too bright and crowded for my taste.   I would have tried it again, but several months later I found Max Brenner, which was everything I wanted Serendipity to be.
443	0	... Whattttt- This place is almost as big of a rip off as that Dragon Noodle place, however, this place tasted slightly better.  Mini Wontons = Wonton wrapper. -_________- wtc. All this craziness. I literally had doughy wrapper in soup for lunch. I mean their soup is light and flavorful but it tasted like misc. powder made soup. It was also extremely salty.  The Lai Mien (hand pulled noodles) wasn't bad, but after awhile it tastes redundant. It's a little bit on the chewy side for me too. There was a tiny piece of beef that came with my soup noodle, it was saddening.  I absolutely had nothing for the spicy cold noodles.  Their portions might look tiny but it's actually a pretty hefty serving. So do keep that in mind when you see the price.  But for $20/dish (on average), I would rather have a Subway sandwich, 4 times.
1807	1	Reminds me a lot of The Cheesecake Factory with the extensive menu. Decided on splitting the pasta promanado with a side of spinach with my lovely dinner date.  There was plenty of seating and great hosts and servers.  The sourdough bread was another favorite get a second order with a pasta.
829	0	I have been to this location many times and, as usual, it disappointed me again. I always hope that things will change but they don't. The Founders Sirloin Filet that they advertise is extremely fatty and very tough to chew. The Garlic Marinated Sirloin is rationed. If you want more than one piece you need to make a second trip to get it. Apparently the employees can only give you one piece at a time. A lot of the dishes were not at the proper temperature (not hot enough). The service is terrible. When I pointed out a problem to one of the management team I was told "Don't worry about it" as if this person could not be bothered. I drove quite a distance to eat here because it's the only Golden Corral in Las Vegas. No more. I'm not going to waste precious gas to be disappointed and treated like crap. I'd rather eat at Burger King.
1632	0	Their attitude is so rude, make sure you don't go to this club if you are Asian! I wear according to the dress code with a dress-like shoes. They kicked my group out because of one pair of fking shoes with a very rude attitude. The other white group got in with sneakers. Like WTF!!! Make sure you never book for Tao if you want to have fun in Vegas.
1562	0	this club is ridiculously crowded. i had to take a fat piss while i was on the dance floor, and it took me 20 minutes to shove my way into the bathroom We were living in Pallazo so we got on the guest list and got in for free.  This place is a cock fest, so be prepared for that, which is weird cause while we were waiting in line, it seems like they were only letting girls in.   There are half naked girls in the pool when you first walk in, and although you would think it would be hot, its really not. Its actually quite creepy, because they just start at you with blank faces. Looks like they're super high or something. Then upstairs, there are girls touching each other on stage, which you would also think is hot, but is actually pretty creepy, b/c they are expressionless and seem very robotic.   Drinks are watered down, bartender was terrible even though I was tipping her hella $$$.   This place attracts nerdy Asian/white guys who think they are badass, but theses are the dudes that play warcraft when they're not in vegas, so you know what I mean. The only game they have is leveling up their character on their computers. I had to constantly swat fobby looking predators away from my female friends.  Go to Tryst instead.
1245	1	Sad fact: I've lived in Vegas for over seven years, and it's only recently that I had a chance to eat here. Sad, I know, but with the Riviera closing recently, the lure of "Old Vegas" got me in the mood to try more classics.  Worth the wait.  The place scream '80's neon decor. It's a lively atmosphere with music videos on the TVs. Without a doubt, the vibe of the place was the biggest appeal to me here. I tried one of their benedicts, and the flavor had me charging through my meal (it can be said in my defense that I was very hungry that night). Again, I sampled their Bloody Mary, and that was "Yes" and "Please".  I did not, however, sample their Fireside Lounge this outing, but I did go in to check it out. I love their fire pit. It's really impressive, and now I have to find an excuse to go dress up and experience it proper.  This is a classic restaurant. My only regret is not visiting it sooner now that I've been able to experience its food and appeal. While I have grumbled in the past that Vegas doesn't respect its history, I hope they have the smarts to leave this landmark location alone, and let it continue to do its thing.  I can see this becoming one of my new favorites.
1027	1	OMG!!!  this place is the best, as soon as i found it, i came back every day i was in town!  I always get a couple slices of the White pizza, a lot of garlic, but i like that!  it is really good, thats just my opinion!  A must go to spot at the Cosmo!
734	0	The worst food I've had in my life.  Service was hurried and the server scowled at us throughout.  Admittedly, the place was crowded but please - do your job professionally.  This place is not cheap.  $15 or so for a Cobb salad.  The lettuce was dry and tasteless, and straight from the freezer.  The chicken breasts were still icy cold and the whole plate was dry - not a drop of dressing.  The bacon bits were so dry that they chafed my mouth.  I had a bite, and even though I was hungry, I didn't eat another spoon.  The server just checked on us once more to serve us water and we didn't see her again until she came back with the whopping bill.  I didn't dare to send the food back or complain because I've heard of stories of American servers spitting in food and worse.  I just paid the bill - hope you learn from my terrible experinece and go someplace better.  We love the food at Venetians.  Go spend your hard-earned money in a better place.
1783	0	The decor is kind of the most interesting part of the whole thing. We came at the tail end of breakfast it's all self served. The food was meh not the best. The reason they got two stars and not one is, I really wanted waffles. They where out but were able to scrounge up a few in the back. To bad they where soggy but they got a star for effort.
647	1	Came here on Monday, and 1$ shots and 1$ beer! How can you say no?! What a great place to pre-game before hitting up Marquee nightclub. And must I say their burgers are out of this world! My friend and I got the kobe beef burger and the steakhouse burger and split them. Just some excellent quality meat... The taste was great too, but it mostly comes from their meat quality, so my hat off to Holsteins. Oh, and let's not forget their crunchy shoe string fries! Yummm... Okay I'm starting to sound like a fatty so I will end it here... Next time I come, I will try the shakes!
703	0	The line to pay and then to be seated on a Saturday (07/12/14) night around 7pm was not bad at all. As far as the food goes I had some really impressive salads (a fruit one comes to mind). I liked the entree options but nothing was that memorable. Pretty standard Vegas buffet food.  The one problem that I was that my boyfriend added on the all you can drink (wine, beer, etc) option. We each ordered a beer (he was brought the wrong one, but just decided to drink it), his second he finally got the one he wanted, but this is where it went bad. He went to get another plate of food so I ordered his 3rd beer for him. It took 30+ minutes to get it which included being brushed off at the cashier station and then having to get the manager involved. The manager said he would talk to the waitress, but no real action was taken. I never went back up to try any of the deserts because I was at the table hoping we would get our drinks while he was having to actually leave the table to get served. I even contacted them when we got home and was told that they would give me a priority reservation the next time I went to the buffet.   My advice is if you eat there do not add the all you can drink option. I don't know if they only want to allow you to have 2, then they should call it $11.99 for 2 drinks. I am sure people would still order that.   There are a lot of options in Vegas so I will not be returning to this buffet. I may never stay at this hotel because of the level of non-customer service that we received which is a shame because it was an option for our upcoming trip.
116	1	This was my second visit and I was just as pleased as the first.  We found Lotus of Siam via a new acquaintance last time we were in Vegas.  We were unable to get a reservation (the history on my phone shows 27 attempted calls, all of which received a busy signal), so we showed up at 5:20 on a Friday night.  They open at 5:30, and we were not the first in line.  We walked in right after the door opened, got a great table, and enjoyed a fabulous meal and glass of wine.    I am gluten-free, and have been pleased that they will accommodate different preparations of certain dishes to meet that dietary need.    Their wine list is impressive, and not ridiculously overpriced.  When we left a little after 6:30 every table was full, the vestibule was packed, and several diners were waiting outside (yes, in the skeezy strip mall).  The moral of the story is that this place is worth the stop, even at what many would consider the "Senior" dining hour.
1351	1	The bf and I ate here for our Valentines day breakfast. We loved it here!!  We had the corn beef hash, French Toast, and Croque Madame. The corn beef had cubed potatoes that were crispy. The Croque Madame's sauce had a rich tasty sauce and a lot of fries! The portions here are pretty big. Last but not least the french toast was different. It just had a lot of fruit. It reminded us of an upside down pineapple cake. Overall, the staff was exceptional, food was great, and the ambience was inviting nothing too fancy.
1952	0	It would be zero stars if there was an option.   I will ever visit this place again. It was not busy when we arrived but we still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. That should have been my 1st clue to leave.    When we were finally seated the waitress appeared offering water we were already prepared to place our order from waiting so long.  She took our drinks order and about 15 min later the drinks arrived. My drink came in this Palm tree plastic cup hmm ok whatever it taste good so we placed our food orders and waited and waited about 30 min which would have been fine except when they brought the orders out it was the wrong items. I ordered the BLT wrap which was correct but my husband who is super sensitive with his food had ordered the carnitas plate. They bought him tacos. He is a diabetic and was very hungry and edgy at this point. We did not take the tacos the waitress said he ordered tacos my husband said no I ordered the carnitas plate. We said being the check.   Check arrived and they charged me $24 for my drink WHAT it was from the slush machine I was charged $11.25 for the plastic Palm tree cup I told her I didn't ask for the take home cup and didn't want it. She said you can just leave it then.     By this time I had it wrong food order waiting forever to be treated like this. Never again  I will be sure to share my review with others
1341	0	I finally visited Senor Frog's after spending my whole life seeing it as THE place to visit in Cancun while on Spring Break.  I expected to pay a premium on food because of the location on the strip so I hoped the food would deliver.  I ordered a BBQ chicken wrap after the server said they are huge.  What I got was not huge, but I figured whatever, this is no Hash House A Go Go! :)  I don't know if the wrap was supposed to be warm or cold, because different parts were warm (like the chicken), but the lettuce and sauce was ice cold.  Also as I got to both ends of my half-cut wrap, the end was just a ton of sauce with no chicken, not really the best way to end the meal.  On the other hand the fries and chips and salsa were really good, so that was a plus. (I believe we had to pay for the chips though)  I don't have much of a reason to come back here, I can get a bigger and better sandwich somewhere else for half the price.  I'm sure you can do worse, but you can do a lot better on the strip for the same price point.
714	0	This review is for the casino only, and after hanging out there for a couple hours, I probably would not consider getting a room here, even if it was free. I'm the kind of person that doesn't mind paying a little more for service, or at least some personality.   I dropped my money off at the blackjack tables, and the roullete table, and of the six or seven different dealers that ran them, NOT ONE was polite, funny or even smiling. If you're gonna take my money, at least give me a smile. Smiles are free at McDonalds, and they have a dollar menu. The last table I played, the Roullete dealer barked at me for picking up my chips too soon, and gave me a look that made me want to knock his nose in. The waitress that was taking drinks at first did not want to give me a drink because I wasn't seated, and when I showed her my stack of chips on the table, she rolled her eyes back and said, "well whadda ya want then?" Don't these people work on tips? Yeah, stay the hell away from this place.
1214	1	Stellar restaurant in Vegas at the Palazzo (hidden on the 10th floor) where everything - from the bread to the desserts - is made with quality ingredients. This restaurant is great. 3 times I went there for breakfast or dinner and each time it was divine. Service is efficient. Staff is rather friendly and the food is definitely exceptional. 5 stars well deserved Mr Keller.
791	1	Found another bomb breakfast place in Vegas!! this place is on the Zagat list so that's why it gets a lot of ppl there every morning!! we ordered the steak benedict n the corned beef. Let me tell u this... the steak benedict was sooo good lots of steak in it so I was really full after! but the corned beef was even better!! My gf ordered that one wanna swtich with her hahah kinda far from the strip but its worth the drive tho!!
1519	0	Got to say this was the second Halloween we have spent here, this year and last year.  Very disappointed.  We had a group of ten plus people for two years and a row.  We ate dinner, it was mediocre at best.  Chicken tacos where dry and no flavor, basically just cooked chicken with cheese on top.  Enchiladas were ok, I could do a better job cooking at home, kind of sad for Vegas.  Last night oct 31, 2014, partied all night there after dinner.  Spent $60+ on dinner, plus $35 for all you can drink for myself and $55 for my wife's top shelf all you can drink.  Pretty reasonable drinking price for Vegas, but by 2 am tried to order tap water, in my all you can drink cup, and the bartender said $4 for a bottled water.  I said no tap water for free in my cup, he said no again trying to get me to buy a bottled water.  As we argued back and forth I finally gave up.  My wife went to the manager and complained how much money we spent for all you can drink and dinner, and that we should at least get our free water.  Crazy!  Then during the costume contest confetti was sprayed throughout the crowd, of course what do you do with confetti other than throw it.  Everyone was doing it, but the manager came over and grabbed my hand said not to throw the confetti.  He then grabbed my wife's hand too, I told him to let her go.  I can't believe he had the nerve to put his hand on her.  I was so pissed.  Unbelievable this guy is a manager.  This will be the last time our group goes to seor frogs.
1810	1	This restaurant is everything a restaurant should be.  Great food, great service, great value.  First, they made a simple omelette amazing wiht freshly roasted vegtables, home-made (real) hash brown potatoes and even a great bagel.  We each had a spicy bloody mary which was really amazing.  Lastly, we had the beignets as breakfast dessert.  The service was really great.  A very relaxed and enjoyable experience.  The rest of the menu looked great and can't wait to come back again soon.  Run don't wakl to Grand Lux Cafe.
916	0	Came with my family i paid for four an my cousin paid for four an they refused to sit us together they said it was against company policy with so many empty tables unless we paid 18% gratuity for serving water an soda.  Food wasn't fantastic spit 3 things out crab legs were dry so was the brisket, and ham. How can you mess up butter
1309	1	We had the best service. In fact, that is the reason we went back. Yet, we had exceptional service from an exceptional waitress named, Jena on our last day in Vegas. In fact, a group from another table commented on our great waitress. They had observed her and couldnt believe how kind she was. She was very personable, reviewed the menu, wasnt overbearing, followed thru with questions, quick service...and the food was seasoned great!    Even the mgr, Anthony came over to our table. He was very personable. I felt like I was a high roller or even better they were welcoming me a a guest in their home.  Jena wasnt giving the best service for a tip but because she wanted our experience to be the best. ....The next time you are in Vegas, go see Jena. And, yes make sure you give her a great tip!  Oh, I had the chicken & shrimp jambalya-thought I was in New Orleans. Chicken & waffles-yummy! ..Pomegranate champagne-delicious! You must try the bread pudding!!!   You may want to take it back to your hotel room for a mid day aphrodisiac. Seriously, there has to be a magic potion in it. We ate this and lets just say I never knew "O's" were so palatable.
1903	1	Found this place on Yelp and our meal was awesome! For five of us we got a meal for four and it was more than enough. Also, a pitcher of Sapporo for happy hour after 10pm -- can't beat that!   Our server, Donkey, was outstanding as well. Will definitely return and recommend to others.
158	1	If your looking for a great Breakfast spot in the LV area, look no further.  This place was great.  I ordered 2 eggs over-easy, with Potatoes and bacon.  My wife got an omlet.  We also ordered a biscuits and gravy.  Everything was AMAZING!!!!!!  It can get kind of crowded in the AM on the weekends but its worth it.
707	1	This is one of my favorite places to take friends from out of town- I have friends who saw this on Man vs. Food and were dying to try it.  They absolutely loved it, and of course none of us could finish our meals.  I love the chicken and waffles, which is big enough for two people to split and have some left over to take home. My second favorite dish is the grilled cheese with avocado, each slice of bread is close to 2 inches thick, and that's amazing in my book.  The second best thing is the drink menu, which has all sorts of amazing drinks that are basically desserts in their own right- hot chocolate, flavored coffee and cappucinos, etc.  I don't drink alcohol, so it's always nice to see a drink menu with special items that I can actually enjoy.
1190	1	Service: No complaints! Server was very nice and attentive!  Atmosphere: Contemporary and nice! There is this neat sign near the entrance that lights up with fire   Food: One of the BEST places on the strip for a burger. My favorite is the Euro Burger. Their shakes are also very good. Be careful though the shake and burger combo is too filling for most. I suggest sharing your shake with another person.  Price: Reasonable. Around $15 for a burger. Unlike some other places, you do have to order fries separately (which runs around $8 to $13)   Overall: Highly Recommend!
1711	1	WARNING!!! DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU HAVE A HUUUUUGE APPETITE!!!  My wife and I just spent the weekend in LV and ended up going to the HHGG twice for breakfast.  The food is awesome and the servings are insanely huge.  Servers, as busy as they are, are polite and friendly.  This is a must visit place that will not let you down.   NICE JOB HHGG!
2	1	Secret Pizza is so much fun to take people to!  They do pizza exceptionally well...nice crispy bottom, chewy crust, great sauce.  It is not my all-time-favorite or anything, but on taste alone I'd hand out 4.5 stars.    Any two of the following puts it in a unique place that is well deserved of 5 stars for me:  It is called Secret Pizza for a reason, there are no signs; it is not located on the restaurant listing for the Cosmopolitan. Walking down the hall to a hidden gem is half the fun!  Then there is the fact that you can get a quality IPA on tap.  The wall of records is is incredibly cool, and the black & white tile fits so perfectly.  Pizza + secret + atmosphere + IPA = an easy 5 stars in my book.  I will take out-of-town friends here anytime, but i'd also stop in for a slice if I was anywhere near the cosmo!
1720	0	8/14/10 1 stars for service but 4 stars for the Jackpot Sundae!...the Sundae was simply amazing...chocolate and strawberry icecream with chocolate and strawberry syrup and much more...If you don't want to wait, it's first come first serve at the bar...we had waited about 30 minutes before the hostess told us about this...WTH?   We were sort of upset at the way the bartenders treated us...they had made EXTRA frozen hot chocolate..the BF simply asked if we could pay extra just to try a little shot/cup of it to see what it was like because it was our first time there!...he just shook his head and said we had our dessert coming up and DUMPED it down the drain...OKAY..fine...it didn't hurt to ask...SO A NEW group 2 couples, young, pretty, NOT Asian like us apparently show up and have a seat and they (bartenders) are drooling over the girls...apparently 1 girl has never tried their famous frozen hot chocolate...so what does the bartender do? HE GIVES her ENTIRE CUP for FREE to TRY...WTF is that about? Seriously? RIGHT IN FRONT OF US TOO...OMG...the BF and I looked at each other like...did he just really do that?   After that it went downhill...truly...Given that I'm about all about being open-minded...I did my best to give the guys there the benefit of the doubt, but this was seriously Ridiculous...I don't think we'll ever be going back there again...
1237	0	If you're planning on paying for a buffet on the Strip, allow me to convince you otherwise, because it is definitely not worth it. However, if you find yourself with some complementary buffet vouchers, let the Wycliff flow! Most of the food here is standard buffet, which is to say, bad, but there are some palatable items to be had if you look carefully enough. I went with the gyros, available near the salad bar. Also acceptable-looking were the salads themselves. For dessert, I hunkered down for some frozen instant pudding (or gelato, as they call it around these parts), which tasted good enough. As an aside, I noticed a lot of people putting their faith in the raw bar here, and I haven't heard news of a salmonella outbreak, so that's something. Sparkling wine is complementary, so drink up!
1140	1	We had a 5 star experience with 13 guests in a private area.  Service was excellent and timely.  We first received bread basket.  Then a great warm spinach & artichoke dip with pita chips.  My ginger beef was delish.  My neighbor's beef wellington was beautiful.  Another's chicken parm was excellent.  Their dessert carrot cake is excellent-well balanced.  Their prices are reasonable for such a class act.  They did take a long time between dinner and dessert-we were in there well over two hours but it was a perfect dining experience for our celebrating group.
60	1	Great environment. The wait wasn't too bad Friday morning. They are very attentive. Got the enchilada omelet and really liked it. What I liked more was the potatoes. Seasoning was amazing on the potatoes. The banana muffin you get for free is surprisingly good too.
227	0	I went to lunch around 3pm with no line. Awesome right? Anyways the food was ok. Decent. Better than hometown imo but my gripe is the staff. My server sucks. Never once did she ask if I wanted a refill on my drink and my plates were stacked 4 high...  I had to complain to the floor manager Anthony. He apologized but still the lack of professionalism had caused me to have an awful experience. Don't know if I would go back.  If I do it would ve because of the floor manager
1520	0	Awh. My meal here was $27 and I got a hamburger and fries and a pop.  My friend and I could not agree on a place to eat, and by this time on our trip, tensions were running high between us. We compromised on I  Burgers. This was in the Palazzo, where we were doing some high end shopping and browsing.  I eat hamburger and fries a lot, and I was unimpressed by this high end place. I love going out to eat at nice places and am willing to spend the money, but this to me was not better quality than a Mcdonalds. (Which I hate) I wouldn't come here again. I understand that it is in the Palazzo, but I still don't see why the prices were so high.  It was just a hamburger and fries to me, but my friend did get a nice Tshirt here that brightened up the journey.
274	0	MEH.  I stayed here over labor day weekend (I'm checking out as we speak) and I was not impressed at all. The lobby still looks like it did in the 90s. The gift shop is not remotely up to par with many of the other local hotels. Pretty sure the ugliest shirts ever are sold there and they haven't remodeled since I was 12.  I stayed on the 25th floor. The rooms were updated since the 90s but for some reason they couldn't spend the $20 to cover up the hole between the front door and the carpet.  That being said, I can hear AND feel anytime someone nearby walks by or closes/opens their door. This is absurd for a hotel that is supposedly high end. The doors don't seem to be shut solid so it also shakes anything a door is closed.   So if you need a hotel in Vegas but don't plan on sleeping this is your place to be. Just make sure you don't pay a lot of $ for your room. They don't charge for wifi which is nice at least.
1738	0	I stayed at LVH for a week in Jan 2013.  I was extremely disappointed ... pretty dirty (stains on the carpet, food trays with leftovers in the hallway, old fashioned rooms, etc).  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the big screens in the sports area of the casino was nice and the buffet food was edible.  Also the check in and out process was easy and quick.   Other than that, this hotel sucked ... and i wont be back.
1511	1	The Atmosphere:  5/5  A cool design with the chunnel bar separating the lounge from the two story dining room.  The open kitchen ads to the energy.  The servers & bar staff are all wearing classy dress shirts with suspenders and ties, (some of the guys could have their shirts tailored though to perfect the look).  The cutlery, plate-ware, linens and glassware were unique and classy. They looked and felt very expensive, these little touches add value for me.  The Food: 5/5  The shrimp cocktail was good, The Beef Wellington was incredible!  Probably the most flavorful piece of beef I've ever enjoyed. It's one of those types of dishes that many restaurants are scared to serve because it can taste pretty ordinary if it's not prepared correctly.  I won't be ordering it anywhere else because Gordon Ramsey's version has set the bar too high.   Also, get the sticky toffee dessert, our server suggested it and we really enjoyed that too.  I'll get the Beef Wellington and Sticky Toffee dessert again but I'll try other apps and sides next time.  The Drinks:  5/5  Between my wife and I, we ordered the strawberry martini, two Drifters, HK Antioxidant, Pims Cup and a cappuccino with dessert.  We are normally wine drinkers but we saw a lot of value in their cocktails.  The Drifter was my favorite (I love a good whiskey) and my wife enjoyed the HK antioxidant the most.  The Service: 4/5  We arrived without a reservation and found two seats at the bar.  When we sat down, the bar staffed were getting crushed by the nonstop drink orders and all of the bar guests.  Their cocktails are pretty labor intensive, so they take awhile to make.  Once they caught up, all three of them were very attentive and personable.  We didn't have to wait long for the food at all.  The restaurant just opened three weeks ago and the staff is probably still working out a lot of kinks, hence a few poor yelp reviews about the pace of service.  We had very friendly service at the bar and we'll sit there again.  Summary:  My wife and I own two restaurants and are big fans of eating at chef driven restaurants when we go out.  We've been to Vegas every year for the last five years and Gordon Ramsey's Steak was one of our fondest memories of any of our Las Vegas trips.  Can't wait to go back!
47	1	It's the place to get a burger.  It's a tradition for our group of friends when we visit Vegas to head over to Burger Bar for dinner.  Build your own burger with best ingredients.  Sides are good too.  100% of the time I've gone to Burger Bar, my burger is cooked perfectly the way I order.  For fresh fancy burgers, medium rare is the way to go in my opinion.  Plus, this week when went, for the 1st time we ordered the Kobe Burger to see what the hype was about.  YUM.  Kobe Burger lives up to it's hype for sure.  (oh and once, a friend ordered veggie patty and vinaigrette salad, she wasn't super happy with her meal).  Burger Bar = stick w/ the burgers.
428	1	My wife and I know breafast fare, and we think Bouchon is the best anywhere, bar none.  Yesterday morning was our second visit to Bouchon - the first was a couple years ago.  The setting feels elegant and calm, in stark contrast to manic hustle of the Las Vegas Strip.  My wife ordered the Quiche du Jour, which yesterday was a quiche florentine (spinach and cheese), served with a simple salad of lightly dressed greens.  I had the Croque Madame (toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce) which was served with more french fries than I deserved.  Seriously, Chef, you can pull back on the volume of fries.  But everything, from the complimentary bread served with butter and incredible jam, to the perfect quiche to the wonderful croque, was FANTASTIC.  Highly recommend.  Only criticism was they were a bit snooty when my wife and I tried to swing by for lunch the day before - seems strange that they say they are open for lunch but close at 1 pm.  Regardless, we can't wait to come back.
1696	0	This place is a royal rip off.   Because of the location on The Strip, they get by with mediocre bar food for entrees, poor service, and a snobby attitude, and at a Las Vegas Premium Price.   Deserts are decent, but stay away from the main courses. You can do a lot better.  Be prepared for a long wait, as well.   If this place were in any other location, it would have been closed a long time ago. However, as long as there are young college kids, who have Dad's money to spend, and don't care about price, it will continue to flourish.
960	1	Best burgur of my life.  I was so excited to eat here and it lived up to every expectation.  I'm so happy I was able to go here on my trip.  The quality of everything was so good.  The sweet potato fries and truffle oil fries are a must.  Hells kitchen burger was so good roasted tomatoes and jalapeos and avocado.  So good!  It's definitely a must if in Vegas.
